00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.470
Hello and welcome I am Raghav from automation
step by step dotcom and in this session and

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.590
in this series we are going to go very basic
step by step and we're going to learn karate

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.039
API testing Framework so in this session we
are going to go very basic from scratch and

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:24.069
we will learn what is Karate what are the
features of karate and then we will see the

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:29.710
project setup and how to create the very first
test in Karate so this is going to be very

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.040
easy and very interesting let us start with
what is karate karate is open source tool

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:43.420
or open source platform for API testing and
we can test both soap and rest API using Karate

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.920
it is written in Java and we can do API mocking
UI testing and performance testing of the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.530
API is as well using karate and its uses BD
Sintex so we are going to use the behaviour

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.100
driven development Syntax and we are going
to use the feature files and the scenarios

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.450
in Karate now just in case you are completely
new to be didi and want to understand exactly

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.930
what is bdd from scratch you can go on my
website that is automation step by step dotcom

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:26.810
and here you will find a topic and the section
on basics of BD and this will take you to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.830
my YouTube playlist where you will see all
the beginners video for BD frequency hear

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.160
what is BD with examples how did you work
how did you started what is haircon how did

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:47.240
it starts in an organisation and a complete
workflow of BD so you can watch that and this

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.890
is what we are going to use the BD Sintex
in karate karate was created by Peter Thomas

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.220
in 2017 so with this very basic knowledge
that is see some awesome features of karate

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.490
so this is very easy for non programmers All
The Karate is written in Java but for implementation

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.520
we are going to use Beat It is Intex using
Jharkhand language which is which is very

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.800
Plain English type of language and I will
show you how exactly do that so it is very

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.940
easy even if you have no program in background
it is written in Java but implemented using

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.870
bdd style and it requires no technical programming
language should not worry if you are a completely

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.700
new to coding or you do not have any programming
background you can still work with Karate

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.840
between two parallel testing as well as distributed
testing in Karate is so parallel testing is

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.500
when we can run multiple test cases at once
in parallel and distributed testing is when

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.371
we can run our test cases on multiple platforms
or from multiple systems we can do multi environment

00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:54.640
testing we can set up multiple environments
and then do our testing and then we can also

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.880
get our data from external files like csv
Jaise on gem Electra there are very good features

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.260
of debugging and multiple reporting features
in Karate and we can do cross browser web

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.321
UI testing as well as clock cross-platform
desktop testing using Karate portable start

00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:20.930
the setup of power project in case you have
any questions any doubts related to this session

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.810
you can let me know and I will try to answer
your as soon as I can and then we will move

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.709
on to the next topic so I hope this was useful
and now we will move to the prerequisites

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.269
and setup for karate
