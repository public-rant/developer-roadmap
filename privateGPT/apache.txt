## apache

 An Apache web server is a free and open source HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) server that presents websites to viewers who come across its servers so, if one wants to deploy a website for business or organization purposes they would most likely use it. There are other popular options such as IIs or Jinks but Apache serves the standard in web development which is followed by majority of people whether their on Linux machines Windows computers and Mac. NGINX also uses PHP��s built-in FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) to pair up with a lightweight, high performance Web Server such as ngiNx for serving multiple concurrent requests effectively without much memory used while virtual servers don't have enough resources left over to spare it seems like the best option.

PHP, via PHP’s built-in FastCGI Process Manager (FPM), pairs really
   nicely with [https://nginx.org/]nginx, which is a lightweight,
   high-performance web server. It uses less memory than Apache and can
   better handle more concurrent requests. This is especially important on
   virtual servers that don’t have much memory to spare.
