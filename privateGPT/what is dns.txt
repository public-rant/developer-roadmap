what is dns

> Answer (took 168.2 s.):
 Domain Name System(DNS) is a phonebook that translates human-readable website addresses (domain name), such as "www." to IP numbers for computer networks and devices on which web browsers run, thus allowing users access resources online through domain names.

A software web server has a number of software components that regulate how hosted files are accessed by online users. This is at the very least an HTTP server. Software that knows and understands HTTP and URLs (web addresses) is known as an HTTP server (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). The content of these hosted websites is sent to the end userâ€™s device through an HTTP server, which may be accessed via the domain names of the websites it holds.
