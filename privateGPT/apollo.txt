## apollo

 Apolo is software that helps with building unified graphs, enabling communication between clients (web or native apps) to interact with your backend services. It was installed and used in the provided context before showing an example code snippet on how it can be integrated into a client's application using GraphQL API as well as connecting through its provider tags for easy access of APIs from within itself. The error library inside Apolo is called "Error", which logs any errors encountered during communication between clients with servers, and allows developers to detect if there were no issues in their system while making the request via an HTTP endpoint on a server's end or using a client-side API like GraphQL through its provider tag integration.

started our client so this right now
it s done for
setting up the graphql connection and
honestly just skip around after this

easier
so now that we have this we can
basically wrap our
whole application with an apollo
provider
and what will this do basically between
this apollo provider tags
is where you can reach all the like your
your graphql api so it s going to be
served through this
