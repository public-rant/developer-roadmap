What is the difference between webpage, website, web server, and search
engine?

   In this article, we describe various web-related concepts: web pages,
   websites, web servers, and search engines. These terms are often
   confused by newcomers to the web or are incorrectly used. Let's learn
   what they each mean!
   Prerequisites: You should know
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_me
   chanics/How_does_the_Internet_work]how the Internet works.
   Objective: Be able to describe the differences between a web page, a
   website, a web server, and a search engine.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanic
s/Pages_sites_servers_and_search_engines#summary]Summary

   As with any area of knowledge, the web comes with a lot of jargon.
   Don't worry. We won't overwhelm you with all of it (we have a
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary]glossary if you're
   curious). However, there are a few basic terms you need to understand
   at the outset since you'll hear these expressions all the time as you
   read on. It's easy to mix these terms since they refer to related but
   different functionalities. You'll sometimes see these terms misused in
   news reports and elsewhere, so getting them mixed up is understandable.

   We'll cover these terms and technologies in more detail as we explore
   further, but these quick definitions will be a great start for you:

   web page
          A document which can be displayed in a web browser such as
          Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari.
          These are also often called just "pages."

   website
          A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually
          connected together in various ways. Often called a "website" or
          a "site."

   web server
          A computer that hosts a website on the Internet.

   search engine
          A web service that helps you find other web pages, such as
          Google, Bing, Yahoo, or DuckDuckGo. Search engines are normally
          accessed through a web browser (e.g. you can perform search
          engine searches directly in the address bar of Firefox, Chrome,
          etc.) or through a web page (e.g.
          [https://www.bing.com/]bing.com or
          [https://duckduckgo.com/]duckduckgo.com).

   Let's look at a simple analogy — a public library. This is what you
   would generally do when visiting a library:
    1. Find a search index and look for the title of the book you want.
    2. Make a note of the catalog number of the book.
    3. Go to the particular section containing the book, find the right
       catalog number, and get the book.

   Let's compare the library with a web server:
     * The library is like a web server. It has several sections, which is
       similar to a web server hosting multiple websites.
     * The different sections (science, math, history, etc.) in the
       library are like websites. Each section is like a unique website
       (two sections do not contain the same books).
     * The books in each section are like webpages. One website may have
       several webpages, e.g., the Science section (the website) will have
       books on heat, sound, thermodynamics, statics, etc. (the webpages).
       Webpages can each be found at a unique location (URL).
     * The search index is like the search engine. Each book has its own
       unique location in the library (two books cannot be kept at the
       same place) which is specified by the catalog number.

s/Pages_sites_servers_and_search_engines#deeper_dive]Deeper dive

   So, let's dig deeper into how those four terms are related and why they
   are sometimes confused with each other.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanic
s/Pages_sites_servers_and_search_engines#web_page_2]Web page

   A web page is a simple document displayable by a
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browser]browser.
   Such documents are written in the
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML]HTML language
   (which we look into in more detail in
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML]other articles). A
   web page can embed a variety of different types of resources such as:
     * style information — controlling a page's look-and-feel
     * scripts — which add interactivity to the page
     * media — images, sounds, and videos.

   Note: Browsers can also display other documents such as
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/PDF]PDF files or
   images, but the term web page specifically refers to HTML documents.
   Otherwise, we only use the term document.

   All web pages available on the web are reachable through a unique
   address. To access a page, just type its address in your browser
   address bar:

   Example of a web page address in the browser address bar

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanic
s/Pages_sites_servers_and_search_engines#website_2]Website

   A website is a collection of linked web pages (plus their associated
   resources) that share a unique domain name. Each web page of a given
   website provides explicit links—most of the time in the form of
   clickable portions of text—that allow the user to move from one page of
   the website to another.

   To access a website, type its domain name in your browser address bar,
   and the browser will display the website's main web page, or homepage
   (casually referred as "the home"):

   Example of a website domain name in the browser address bar

   Note that it is also possible to have a single-page website: a site
   that consists of a single web page which is dynamically updated with
   new content when needed.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanic
s/Pages_sites_servers_and_search_engines#web_server_2]Web server

   A web server is a computer hosting one or more websites. "Hosting"
   means that all the web pages and their supporting files are available
   on that computer. The web server will send any web page from the
   website it is hosting to any user's browser, per user request.

   Don't confuse websites and web servers. For example, if you hear
   someone say, "My website is not responding", it actually means that the
   web server is not responding and therefore the website is not
   available. More importantly, since a web server can host multiple
   websites, the term web server is never used to designate a website, as
   it could cause great confusion. In our previous example, if we said,
   "My web server is not responding", it means that multiple websites on
   that web server are not available.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanic
s/Pages_sites_servers_and_search_engines#search_engine_2]Search engine

   Search engines are a common source of confusion on the web. A search
   engine is a special kind of website that helps users find web pages
   from other websites.

   There are plenty out there: [https://www.google.com/]Google,
   [https://www.bing.com/]Bing, [https://yandex.com/]Yandex,
   [https://duckduckgo.com/]DuckDuckGo, and many more. Some are generic,
   some are specialized about certain topics. Use whichever you prefer.

   Many beginners on the web confuse search engines and browsers. Let's
   make it clear: A browser is a piece of software that retrieves and
   displays web pages; a search engine is a website that helps people find
   web pages from other websites. The confusion arises because, the first
   time someone launches a browser, the browser displays a search engine's
   homepage. This makes sense, because, obviously, the first thing you
   want to do with a browser is to find a web page to display. Don't
   confuse the infrastructure (e.g., the browser) with the service (e.g.,
   the search engine). The distinction will help you quite a bit, but even
   some professionals speak loosely, so don't feel anxious about it.

   Here is an instance of Firefox showing a Google search box as its
   default startup page:
