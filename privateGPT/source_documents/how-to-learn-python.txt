What Is The Python Programming Language?

   Python was designed by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch Programmer, and it was
   first released on the 20th of February in 1991.

   The Python Software Foundation, an American non-profit organization,
   has been responsible for promoting, advancing, and fostering the growth
   of the language since 2001.

   When you think of the word Python, an image of a snake probably comes
   to mind.

   But the name of the Python programming language was inspired by a BBC
   comedy series called "Monty Python's Flying Circus", which was popular
   in the 1970s.

   Python is a general-purpose language, and it is used in many fields in
   the technology sector.

   It is a popular language when working with large amounts of data, so
   it's often used for machine learning and data science, as well as data
   analysis and data processing.

   It is also the language of choice for web scraping. Web scraping is an
   automated technique that extracts, collects, and processes large
   amounts of raw data from the web.

   You can also use Python for web development to create powerful web
   applications with the help of frameworks such as Django and Flask.

   In addition, Python is a popular language for test automation.

   Instead of writing all the tests for your programs manually, you can
   rely on automation tools, Python libraries, and Python scripts to get
   the job done.

Why Should You Choose to Learn Python?

   When you first start learning to code, you may become quickly
   overwhelmed by the sheer number of programming languages available to
   learn.

   So, why should you choose to learn Python instead of another language?

   First of all, all programming languages are tools, and they essentially
   give instructions - they tell a computer what to do and what tasks it
   needs to carry out.

   They all have certain concepts and paradigms in common, so when you
   have a good knowledge of one, it is easier to pick up another one later
   down the line.

   That said, there are a few reasons why Python is a great first
   programming language for code newbies.

   First of all, Python is a high-level server-side scripting programming
   language.

   In computing, there are two types of programming languages. There are
   low-level programming languages and high-level ones.

   A high-level programming language means that there is a lot of
   abstraction and separation between the language and the machine-level
   instructions of computers which are written in binary. Binary is a
   numerical system comprised of 1s and 0s.

   High-level languages have a syntax that is much easier to read, learn,
   pick up, and write, as the syntax is human-friendly and resembles the
   English language.

   Python syntax is more concise and less verbose. You can achieve
   something by writing significantly fewer lines of code.

   For example, here is how you write a "Hello World" program in C++:
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
   cout<<"Hello World!";

   return 0;
}

   And here is how you write a "Hello World" program in Python:
print("Hello World")

   It takes fewer lines to achieve the same thing - such as printing
   'Hello World' to a console.

   Not to mention that it is much easier to read and is way more
   straightforward, right?

   Python is an Open Source language, which means it is usable and freely
   distributed for everyone.

   You are also encouraged to [https://github.com/python]contribute to it
   and become part of a big community.

Python 2 vs Python 3 - What's The Difference?

   When you first start learning Python, you will probably come across
   Python 2 and Python 3 and may be confused about the differences between
   the two.

   Over the years, Python has evolved as a language.

   It has gone through constant improvements, bug fixes, and updates with
   new and improved features.

   The last version of Python 2, Python 2.7, is no longer maintained and
   supported. There will be no future updates, such as updates on security
   issues.

   So, Python 2 is outdated and no longer used.

   When you start working as a Python developer, you may come across some
   old codebases with Python 2 code.

   However, this version of the language should not concern you -
   especially as a beginner.

   Python 3 is the newest version of Python. It was created to fix some
   problems in Python 2.

   The many changes and new features it introduced were not compatible
   with Python 2.

   In programming, this is known as backward incompatibility.

   Both versions have significant differences in their syntax.

   One notable difference is when you want to print something to the
   console:
#print is a statement in Python 2
print "Hello World"

#print() is a function in Python 3
# parentheses were introduced

print("Hello World")

   To summarize, the current maintainable standard is Python 3, and if in
   doubt, this is the version of Python you should focus on.

How to Install Python and Set Up a Development Environment

   You will first need to install Python on your local machine.

   Specifically, you will need to install the Python interpreter. The
   Python interpreter is a software program.

   When you write Python code in a file with a .py extension, you need a
   program that will translate your Python code to the language the
   computer understands.

   That program, which acts as the translator, is the Python interpreter.

   Some Operating Systems have the Python interpreter already installed by
   default.

   For example, on macOS, Python 2.x version is installed.

   You can check that by opening a new terminal window (enter the shortcut
   Command Space and type Terminal.app. Then, click on the first option
   that appears).

   Once in the terminal, type python -v, where the -v argument stands for
   version.

   You will see the default 2.x version already on the system.

   However, you do not want to use this version, as it's outdated (which
   we discussed above).

   You can download the Python interpreter no matter your Operating
   System, but the steps for downloading and installing Python will differ
   from Operating System to Operating System.

   At this point, it is also helpful to learn about creating virtual
   environments in Python.

   This will come in handy for your future projects, especially when
   you're working with third-party packages.

   Virtual environments create an isolated space for each of your
   projects, which means that you can create multiple virtual
   environments.

   This will ensure that the dependencies from packages installed in one
   project don't interfere with the rest of your projects.

   Here is a list of resources for installing Python on your local machine
   and for learning more about virtual environments:

       Why It's Useful

   Earlier I mentioned writing Python code in a file with a .py extension.

   But where exactly do you write the Python code? In an IDE (Integrated
   Development Environment).

   Some helpful IDE features are the following:
     * A code editor for writing and editing source code (source code is
       another word for code written in a human-readable programming
       language such as Python),
     * Syntax highlighting (which makes code easier to read), code hints,
       and autocompletion,
     * A built-in terminal for running commands,
     * Debugging and testing tools.

   Essentially an IDE has all the necessary tools for increasing
   programmer productivity, all under the same roof, and
   [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-ide-best-ides-and-editors-for
   -python/]there are many IDEs for writing Python code to choose from.

   Personally, when I first started to learn Python, I found that writing
   Python code in Visual Studio Code was a pleasant experience.

   Visual Studio Code is a free, open-source code editor with powerful
   IDE-like features and offers support for using Python.
