     * HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
     * HTML describes the structure of a Web page
     * HTML consists of a series of elements

       "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

A Simple HTML Document

Example

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
   <title>Page Title</title>
   </head>
   <body>
   <h1>My First Heading</h1>
   <p>My first paragraph.</p>
   </body>
   </html>

   Yourself »

Example Explained

     * The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an
       HTML5 document
     * The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
     * The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
     * The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is
       shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
     * The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container
       for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images,
       hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
     * The <h1> element defines a large heading
     * The <p> element defines a paragraph

What is an HTML Element?

   An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end
   tag:
   <tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>

   The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
   <h1>My First Heading</h1>
   <p>My first paragraph.</p>
   Start tag   Element content   End tag
   <h1>      My First Heading    </h1>
   <p>       My first paragraph. </p>
   <br>      none                none

   Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These
   elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end
   tag!

Web Browsers

   The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read
   HTML documents and display them correctly.

   A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine
   how to display the document:

   View in Browser

HTML Page Structure

   Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:
   <html>
   <head>
   <title>Page title</title>
   </head>
   <body>
   <h1>This is a heading</h1>
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
   <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
   </body>
   </html>

   Note: The content inside the <body> section will be displayed in a
   browser. The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the
   browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
