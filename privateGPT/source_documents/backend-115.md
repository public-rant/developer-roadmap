The Twelve-Factor App is a methodology for building scalable and maintainable software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. It is based on a set of best practices that were identified by the authors of the methodology as being essential for building modern, cloud-native applications.
The Twelve-Factor App methodology consists of the following principles:
The Twelve-Factor App methodology is widely adopted by developers of SaaS applications, and it is seen as a best practice for building cloud-native applications that are scalable, maintainable, and easy to deploy.

Microservice architecture is a pattern in which highly cohesive, loosely coupled services are separately developed, maintained, and deployed. Each component handles an individual function, and when combined, the application handles an overall business function.

Serverless is an architecture in which a developer builds and runs applications without provisioning or managing servers. With cloud computing/serverless, servers exist but are managed by the cloud provider. Resources are used as they are needed, on demand and often using auto scaling.

An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context.The architectural patterns address various issues in software engineering, such as computer hardware performance limitations, high availability and minimization of a business risk.

SOA, or service-oriented architecture, defines a way to make software components reusable via service interfaces. These interfaces utilize common communication standards in such a way that they can be rapidly incorporated into new applications without having to perform deep integration each time.

Monolithic architecture is a pattern in which an application handles requests, executes business logic, interacts with the database, and creates the HTML for the front end. In simpler terms, this one application does many things. It’s inner components are highly coupled and deployed as one unit.

A service mesh is a network of microservices that are connected using a mesh of interconnected, intelligent proxies. It is used to manage and secure communication between microservices, and it provides features such as load balancing, service discovery, and observability.
In a service mesh, each microservice is typically represented by an instance of a lightweight, transparent proxy called an “envoy.” The envoys handle the communication between microservices and provide features such as load balancing, routing, and security.
Service meshes are typically implemented using a sidecar pattern, in which the envoys are deployed alongside the microservices they are responsible for. This allows the service mesh to be decoupled from the microservices and makes it easier to manage and update.
Service meshes are commonly used in cloud-native architectures and are often managed using a control plane, which is responsible for configuring and managing the envoys. Some popular service mesh implementations include Istio and Linkerd.
