     * I really appreciate the combination of hands-on practice,
       additional resources, and segmented lessons. The information is
       accessible and does not intimidate me — as a beginner, this is
       really important. The interface is delightful, and the tone of the
       copy is also very friendly and warm. I have been able to meet my
       weekly goals. Woo!
