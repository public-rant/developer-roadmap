Frequently asked questions about Ruby

     * (BUTTON)

What is Ruby?
       Arrow Chevron Down Icon
       Ruby is an open-source programming language, making it free for
       anyone to use or contribute to. It’s also cross-platform, so you
       can run its code on any operating system. Ruby’s syntax lacks many
       of the special symbols you’ll find in some other languages, and as
       a general-purpose language, it has a wide range of applications.
