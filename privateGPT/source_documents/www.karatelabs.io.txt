   Karate is an open-source unified test automation platform combining API
   testing, API performance testing, API mocks & UI testing. Karate
   customers typically save 80% time when writing tests for a single

   seamlessly into existing infrastructure.

   1+ million monthly downloads, used by 415+ companies including 42 of
   the Fortune 500, are a testimony of Karate making it exceptionally
   simple to write tests (low code), simulating end-user workflows
   accurately, re-using API tests as performance tests, parallel
   execution, collaboration via Git and zero set-up onboarding...
