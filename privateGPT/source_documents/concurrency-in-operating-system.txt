Concurrency in Operating System

   In this article, you will learn the concurrency in the operating system
   with its principles, issues, advantages and disadvantages.

What is Concurrency?

   It refers to the execution of multiple instruction sequences at the
   same time. It occurs in an operating system when multiple process
   threads are executing concurrently. These threads can interact with one
   another via shared memory or message passing. Concurrency results in
   resource sharing, which causes issues like deadlocks and resource
   scarcity. It aids with techniques such as process coordination, memory
   allocation, and execution schedule to maximize throughput.

Principles of Concurrency

   Today's technology, like multi-core processors and parallel processing,
   allows multiple processes and threads to be executed simultaneously.
   Multiple processes and threads can access the same memory space, the
   same declared variable in code, or even read or write to the same file.

   The amount of time it takes a process to execute cannot be simply
   estimated, and you cannot predict which process will complete first,
   enabling you to build techniques to deal with the problems that
   concurrency creates.

   Interleaved and overlapping processes are two types of concurrent
   processes with the same problems. It is impossible to predict the
   relative speed of execution, and the following factors determine it:
    1. The way operating system handles interrupts
    2. Other processes' activities
    3. The operating system's scheduling policies

Problems in Concurrency

   There are various problems in concurrency. Some of them are as follows:

   1. Locating the programming errors

   It's difficult to spot a programming error because reports are usually
   repeatable due to the varying states of shared components each time the
   code is executed.

   2. Sharing Global Resources

   Sharing global resources is difficult. If two processes utilize a
   global variable and both alter the variable's value, the order in which
   the many changes are executed is critical.

   3. Locking the channel

   It could be inefficient for the OS to lock the resource and prevent
   other processes from using it.

   4. Optimal Allocation of Resources

   It is challenging for the OS to handle resource allocation properly.

Issues of Concurrency

   Various issues of concurrency are as follows:

   1. Non-atomic

   Operations that are non-atomic but interruptible by several processes
   may happen issues. A non-atomic operation depends on other processes,
   and an atomic operation runs independently of other processes.

   2. Deadlock

   In concurrent computing, it occurs when one group member waits for
   another member, including itself, to send a message and release a lock.
   Software and hardware locks are commonly used to arbitrate shared
   resources and implement process synchronization in parallel computing,
   distributed systems, and multiprocessing.

   3. Blocking

   A blocked process is waiting for some event, like the availability of a
   resource or completing an I/O operation. Processes may block waiting
   for resources, and a process may be blocked for a long time waiting for
   terminal input. If the process is needed to update some data
   periodically, it will be very undesirable.

   4. Race Conditions

   A race problem occurs when the output of a software application is
   determined by the timing or sequencing of other uncontrollable events.
   Race situations can also happen in multithreaded software, runs in a
   distributed environment, or is interdependent on shared resources.

   5. Starvation

   A problem in concurrent computing is where a process is continuously
   denied the resources it needs to complete its work. It could be caused
   by errors in scheduling or mutual exclusion algorithm, but resource
   leaks may also cause it.

   Concurrent system design frequently requires developing dependable
   strategies for coordinating their execution, data interchange, memory
   allocation, and execution schedule to decrease response time and
   maximize throughput.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Concurrency in Operating System

   Various advantages and disadvantages of Concurrency in Operating
   systems are as follows:

Advantages

   1. Better Performance

   It improves the operating system's performance. When one application
   only utilizes the processor, and another only uses the disk drive, the
   time it takes to perform both apps simultaneously is less than the time
   it takes to run them sequentially.

   2. Better Resource Utilization

   It enables resources that are not being used by one application to be
   used by another.

   3. Running Multiple Applications

   It enables you to execute multiple applications simultaneously.

Disadvantages

    1. It is necessary to protect multiple applications from each other.
    2. It is necessary to use extra techniques to coordinate several
       applications.
    3. Additional performance overheads and complexities in OS are needed
       for switching between applications.
