What is this?

   The first 13 videos are aimed at understanding the fundamentals of
   Flexbox - we will take a deep dive into understanding rows, columns,
   axes, wrapping, alignment, centering and layout. The last 7 are code
   alongs where we will build everything from a navigation to a mobile app
   layout entirely with Flexbox!
