   A process can be of two types:
     * Independent process.
     * Co-operating process.

   An independent process is not affected by the execution of other
   processes while a co-operating process can be affected by other
   executing processes. Though one can think that those processes, which
   are running independently, will execute very efficiently, in reality,
   there are many situations when co-operative nature can be utilized for
   increasing computational speed, convenience, and modularity.
   Inter-process communication (IPC) is a mechanism that allows processes
   to communicate with each other and synchronize their actions. The
   communication between these processes can be seen as a method of
   co-operation between them. Processes can communicate with each other
   through both:

    1. Shared Memory
    2. Message passing

   Figure 1 below shows a basic structure of communication between
   processes via the shared memory method and via the message passing
   method.

   An operating system can implement both methods of communication. First,
   we will discuss the shared memory methods of communication and then
   message passing. Communication between processes using shared memory
   requires processes to share some variable, and it completely depends on
   how the programmer will implement it. One way of communication using
   shared memory can be imagined like this: Suppose process1 and process2
   are executing simultaneously, and they share some resources or use some
   information from another process. Process1 generates information about
   certain computations or resources being used and keeps it as a record
   in shared memory. When process2 needs to use the shared information, it
   will check in the record stored in shared memory and take note of the
   information generated by process1 and act accordingly. Processes can
   use shared memory for extracting information as a record from another
   process as well as for delivering any specific information to other
   processes.
   Let’s discuss an example of communication between processes using the
   shared memory method.


   i) Shared Memory Method

   Ex: Producer-Consumer problem
   There are two processes: Producer and Consumer. The producer produces
   some items and the Consumer consumes that item. The two processes share
   a common space or memory location known as a buffer where the item
   produced by the Producer is stored and from which the Consumer consumes
   the item if needed. There are two versions of this problem: the first
   one is known as the unbounded buffer problem in which the Producer can
   keep on producing items and there is no limit on the size of the
   buffer, the second one is known as the bounded buffer problem in which
   the Producer can produce up to a certain number of items before it
   starts waiting for Consumer to consume it. We will discuss the bounded
   buffer problem. First, the Producer and the Consumer will share some
   common memory, then the producer will start producing items. If the
   total produced item is equal to the size of the buffer, the producer
   will wait to get it consumed by the Consumer. Similarly, the consumer
   will first check for the availability of the item. If no item is
   available, the Consumer will wait for the Producer to produce it. If
   there are items available, Consumer will consume them. The pseudo-code
   to demonstrate is provided below:
   Shared Data between the two Processes

C

   #define buff_max 25
   #define mod %

       struct item{

           // different member of the produced data
           // or consumed data
           ---------
       }

       // An array is needed for holding the items.
       // This is the shared place which will be
       // access by both process
       // item shared_buff [ buff_max ];

       // Two variables which will keep track of
       // the indexes of the items produced by producer
       // and consumer The free index points to
       // the next free index. The full index points to
       // the first full index.
       int free_index = 0;
       int full_index = 0;



   Producer Process Code

C

   item nextProduced;

       while(1){

           // check if there is no space
           // for production.
           // if so keep waiting.
           while((free_index+1) mod buff_max == full_index);

           shared_buff[free_index] = nextProduced;
           free_index = (free_index + 1) mod buff_max;
       }


   Consumer Process Code

C

   item nextConsumed;

       while(1){

           // check if there is an available
           // item  for consumption.
           // if not keep on waiting for
           // get them produced.
           while((free_index == full_index);

           nextConsumed = shared_buff[full_index];
           full_index = (full_index + 1) mod buff_max;
       }


   In the above code, the Producer will start producing again when the
   (free_index+1) mod buff max will be free because if it is not free,
   this implies that there are still items that can be consumed by the
   Consumer so there is no need to produce more. Similarly, if free index
   and full index point to the same index, this implies that there are no
   items to consume.

   ii) Messaging Passing Method

   Now, We will start our discussion of the communication between
   processes via message passing. In this method, processes communicate
   with each other without using any kind of shared memory. If two
   processes p1 and p2 want to communicate with each other, they proceed
   as follows:

     * Establish a communication link (if a link already exists, no need
       to establish it again.)
     * Start exchanging messages using basic primitives.
       We need at least two primitives:
       – send(message, destination) or send(message)
       – receive(message, host) or receive(message)


   The message size can be of fixed size or of variable size. If it is of
   fixed size, it is easy for an OS designer but complicated for a
   programmer and if it is of variable size then it is easy for a
   programmer but complicated for the OS designer. A standard message can
   have two parts: header and body.
   The header part is used for storing message type, destination id,
   source id, message length, and control information. The control
   information contains information like what to do if runs out of buffer
   space, sequence number, priority. Generally, message is sent using FIFO
   style.

   Message Passing through Communication Link.
   Direct and Indirect Communication link
   Now, We will start our discussion about the methods of implementing
   communication links. While implementing the link, there are some
   questions that need to be kept in mind like :

    1. How are links established?
    2. Can a link be associated with more than two processes?
    3. How many links can there be between every pair of communicating
       processes?
    4. What is the capacity of a link? Is the size of a message that the
       link can accommodate fixed or variable?
    5. Is a link unidirectional or bi-directional?

   A link has some capacity that determines the number of messages that
   can reside in it temporarily for which every link has a queue
   associated with it which can be of zero capacity, bounded capacity, or
   unbounded capacity. In zero capacity, the sender waits until the
   receiver informs the sender that it has received the message. In
   non-zero capacity cases, a process does not know whether a message has
   been received or not after the send operation. For this, the sender
   must communicate with the receiver explicitly. Implementation of the
   link depends on the situation, it can be either a direct communication
   link or an in-directed communication link.
   Direct Communication links are implemented when the processes use a
   specific process identifier for the communication, but it is hard to
   identify the sender ahead of time.
   For example the print server.
   In-direct Communication is done via a shared mailbox (port), which
   consists of a queue of messages. The sender keeps the message in
   mailbox and the receiver picks them up.

   Message Passing through Exchanging the Messages.

   Synchronous and Asynchronous Message Passing:
   A process that is blocked is one that is waiting for some event, such
   as a resource becoming available or the completion of an I/O operation.
   IPC is possible between the processes on same computer as well as on
   the processes running on different computer i.e. in
   networked/distributed system. In both cases, the process may or may not
   be blocked while sending a message or attempting to receive a message
   so message passing may be blocking or non-blocking. Blocking is
   considered synchronous and blocking send means the sender will be
   blocked until the message is received by receiver. Similarly, blocking
   receive has the receiver block until a message is available.
   Non-blocking is considered asynchronous and Non-blocking send has the
   sender sends the message and continue. Similarly, Non-blocking receive
   has the receiver receive a valid message or null. After a careful
   analysis, we can come to a conclusion that for a sender it is more
   natural to be non-blocking after message passing as there may be a need
   to send the message to different processes. However, the sender expects
   acknowledgment from the receiver in case the send fails. Similarly, it
   is more natural for a receiver to be blocking after issuing the receive
   as the information from the received message may be used for further
   execution. At the same time, if the message send keep on failing, the
   receiver will have to wait indefinitely. That is why we also consider
   the other possibility of message passing. There are basically three
   preferred combinations:

     * Blocking send and blocking receive
     * Non-blocking send and Non-blocking receive
     * Non-blocking send and Blocking receive (Mostly used)

   In Direct message passing, The process which wants to communicate must
   explicitly name the recipient or sender of the communication.
   e.g. send(p1, message) means send the message to p1.
   Similarly, receive(p2, message) means to receive the message from p2.
   In this method of communication, the communication link gets
   established automatically, which can be either unidirectional or
   bidirectional, but one link can be used between one pair of the sender
   and receiver and one pair of sender and receiver should not possess
   more than one pair of links. Symmetry and asymmetry between sending and
   receiving can also be implemented i.e. either both processes will name
   each other for sending and receiving the messages or only the sender
   will name the receiver for sending the message and there is no need for
   the receiver for naming the sender for receiving the message. The
   problem with this method of communication is that if the name of one
   process changes, this method will not work.
   In Indirect message passing, processes use mailboxes (also referred to
   as ports) for sending and receiving messages. Each mailbox has a unique
   id and processes can communicate only if they share a mailbox. Link
   established only if processes share a common mailbox and a single link
   can be associated with many processes. Each pair of processes can share
   several communication links and these links may be unidirectional or
   bi-directional. Suppose two processes want to communicate through
   Indirect message passing, the required operations are: create a
   mailbox, use this mailbox for sending and receiving messages, then
   destroy the mailbox. The standard primitives used are: send(A, message)
   which means send the message to mailbox A. The primitive for the
   receiving the message also works in the same way e.g. received (A,
   message). There is a problem with this mailbox implementation. Suppose
   there are more than two processes sharing the same mailbox and suppose
   the process p1 sends a message to the mailbox, which process will be
   the receiver? This can be solved by either enforcing that only two
   processes can share a single mailbox or enforcing that only one process
   is allowed to execute the receive at a given time or select any process
   randomly and notify the sender about the receiver. A mailbox can be
   made private to a single sender/receiver pair and can also be shared
   between multiple sender/receiver pairs. Port is an implementation of
   such mailbox that can have multiple senders and a single receiver. It
   is used in client/server applications (in this case the server is the
   receiver). The port is owned by the receiving process and created by OS
   on the request of the receiver process and can be destroyed either on
   request of the same receiver processor when the receiver terminates
   itself. Enforcing that only one process is allowed to execute the
   receive can be done using the concept of mutual exclusion. Mutex
   mailbox is created which is shared by n process. The sender is
   non-blocking and sends the message. The first process which executes
   the receive will enter in the critical section and all other processes
   will be blocking and will wait.
   Now, let’s discuss the Producer-Consumer problem using the message
   passing concept. The producer places items (inside messages) in the
   mailbox and the consumer can consume an item when at least one message
   present in the mailbox. The code is given below:
   Producer Code

C

   void Producer(void){

           int item;
           Message m;

           while(1){

               receive(Consumer, &m);
               item = produce();
               build_message(&m , item ) ;
               send(Consumer, &m);
           }
       }


   Consumer Code

C

   void Consumer(void){

           int item;
           Message m;

           while(1){

               receive(Producer, &m);
               item = extracted_item();
               send(Producer, &m);
               consume_item(item);
           }
       }


   Examples of IPC systems

    1. Posix : uses shared memory method.
    2. Mach : uses message passing
    3. Windows XP : uses message passing using local procedural calls

   Communication in client/server Architecture:
   There are various mechanism:

     * Pipe
     * Socket
     * Remote Procedural calls (RPCs)

   The above three methods will be discussed in later articles as all of
   them are quite conceptual and deserve their own separate articles.

   Inter-process communication (IPC) is the mechanism through which
   processes or threads can communicate and exchange data with each other
   on a computer or across a network. IPC is an important aspect of modern
   operating systems, as it enables different processes to work together
   and share resources, leading to increased efficiency and flexibility.

Advantages of IPC:

    1. Enables processes to communicate with each other and share
       resources, leading to increased efficiency and flexibility.
    2. Facilitates coordination between multiple processes, leading to
       better overall system performance.
    3. Allows for the creation of distributed systems that can span
       multiple computers or networks.
    4. Can be used to implement various synchronization and communication
       protocols, such as semaphores, pipes, and sockets.

Disadvantages of IPC:

    1. Increases system complexity, making it harder to design, implement,
       and debug.
    2. Can introduce security vulnerabilities, as processes may be able to
       access or modify data belonging to other processes.
    3. Requires careful management of system resources, such as memory and
       CPU time, to ensure that IPC operations do not degrade overall
       system performance.
       Can lead to data inconsistencies if multiple processes try to
       access or modify the same data at the same time.
    4. Overall, the advantages of IPC outweigh the disadvantages, as it is
       a necessary mechanism for modern operating systems and enables
       processes to work together and share resources in a flexible and
       efficient manner. However, care must be taken to design and
       implement IPC systems carefully, in order to avoid potential
       security vulnerabilities and performance issues.
