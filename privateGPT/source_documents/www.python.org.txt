Functions Defined
       The core of extensible programming is defining functions. Python
       allows mandatory and optional arguments, keyword arguments, and
       even arbitrary argument lists.

# List and the enumerate function
>>> list(enumerate(fruits))
[(0, 'Banana'), (1, 'Apple'), (2, 'Lime')]

Compound Data Types
       Lists (known as arrays in other languages) are one of the compound
       data types that Python understands. Lists can be indexed, sliced
       and manipulated with other built-in functions.

>>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float

>>> 17 // 3  # floor division
5

Intuitive Interpretation
       Calculations are simple with Python, and expression syntax is
       straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work as expected;
       parentheses () can be used for grouping.

The product is: 384

All the Flow You’d Expect
       Python knows the usual control flow statements that other languages
       speak — if, for, while and range — with some of its own twists, of
       course. [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html]More
