   Reduction of data redundancy

   This article needs attention from an expert in Databases. See the
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Database_normalization#Expanding_on

   Database normalization or database normalisation (see
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_di
   fferences#-ise,_-ize_(-isation,_-ization)]spelling differences) is the
   process of structuring a
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database]relational database
   in accordance with a series of so-called
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms]norm
   al forms in order to reduce
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_redundancy]data redundancy and
   improve [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity]data integrity.
   It was first proposed by
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people]British
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist]computer scientist
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd]Edgar F. Codd as part of
   his [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model]relational model.

   Normalization entails organizing the
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_(database)]columns (attributes)
   and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(database)]tables
   (relations) of a database to ensure that their
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_theory_(database_theory)]depe
   ndencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints. It is
   accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of
   synthesis (creating a new database design) or decomposition (improving
   an existing database design).

Objectives[[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Database_normalization
&action=edit&section=1]edit]

   A basic objective of the first normal form defined by Codd in 1970 was
   to permit data to be queried and manipulated using a "universal data
   sub-language" grounded in
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic]first-order
   logic.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#cite_note-
   1][1] An example of such a language is
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL]SQL, though it is one that Codd
   regarded as seriously
   flawed.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#cite_note
   -2][2]

   The objectives of normalisation beyond 1NF (first normal form) were
   stated by Codd as:

    1. To free the collection of relations from undesirable insertion,
       update and deletion dependencies.
    2. To reduce the need for restructuring the collection of relations,
       as new types of data are introduced, and thus increase the life
       span of application programs.
    3. To make the relational model more informative to users.
    4. To make the collection of relations neutral to the query
       statistics, where these statistics are liable to change as time
       goes by.

   — E.F. Codd, "Further Normalisation of the Data Base Relational
   Model"^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#cite_note-
   3][3]

   ion_anomaly.svg.png]
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Insertion_anomaly.svg]
   An insertion anomaly. Until the new faculty member, Dr. Newsome, is
   assigned to teach at least one course, their details cannot be
   recorded.
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Update_anomaly.svg][280px-Update_an
   omaly.svg.png]
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Update_anomaly.svg]
   An update anomaly. Employee 519 is shown as having different addresses
   on different records.
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deletion_anomaly.svg][280px-Deletio
   n_anomaly.svg.png]
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deletion_anomaly.svg]
   A deletion anomaly. All information about Dr. Giddens is lost if they
   temporarily cease to be assigned to any courses.

   When an attempt is made to modify (update, insert into, or delete from)
   a relation, the following undesirable side effects may arise in
   relations that have not been sufficiently normalized:
     * Insertion anomaly. There are circumstances in which certain facts
       cannot be recorded at all. For example, each record in a "Faculty
       and Their Courses" relation might contain a Faculty ID, Faculty
       Name, Faculty Hire Date, and Course Code. Therefore, the details of
       any faculty member who teaches at least one course can be recorded,
       but a newly hired faculty member who has not yet been assigned to
       teach any courses cannot be recorded, except by setting the Course
       Code to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_(SQL)]null.
     * Update anomaly. The same information can be expressed on multiple
       rows; therefore updates to the relation may result in logical
       inconsistencies. For example, each record in an "Employees' Skills"
       relation might contain an Employee ID, Employee Address, and Skill;
       thus a change of address for a particular employee may need to be
       applied to multiple records (one for each skill). If the update is
       only partially successful – the employee's address is updated on
       some records but not others – then the relation is left in an
       inconsistent state. Specifically, the relation provides conflicting
       answers to the question of what this particular employee's address
       is.
     * Deletion anomaly. Under certain circumstances, the deletion of data
       representing certain facts necessitates the deletion of data
       representing completely different facts. The "Faculty and Their
       Courses" relation described in the previous example suffers from
       this type of anomaly, for if a faculty member temporarily ceases to
       be assigned to any courses, the last of the records on which that
       faculty member appears must be deleted, effectively also deleting
       the faculty member, unless the Course Code field is set to null.

Minimize redesign when extending the database
structure[[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Database_normalization&
action=edit&section=2]edit]

   A fully normalized database allows its structure to be extended to
   accommodate new types of data without changing existing structure too
   much. As a result, applications interacting with the database are
   minimally affected.

   Normalized relations, and the relationship between one normalized
   relation and another, mirror real-world concepts and their
   interrelationships.

Normal
forms[[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Database_normalization&acti
on=edit&section=3]edit]

   Codd introduced the concept of normalization and what is now known as
   the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form]first normal form
   (1NF) in
   1970.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#cite_note-C
   odd1970-4][4] Codd went on to define the
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_normal_form]second normal form
   (2NF) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form]third normal
   form (3NF) in
   1971,^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#cite_note-C
   odd,_E.F_1971-5][5] and Codd and
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_F._Boyce]Raymond F. Boyce
   defined the
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce%E2%80%93Codd_normal_form]Boyce–Cod
   d normal form (BCNF) in
   1974.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#cite_note-C
   oddBCNF-6][6]

   Informally, a relational database relation is often described as
   "normalized" if it meets third normal
   form.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#cite_note-D

   and deletion anomalies.

Example of a step-by-step
normalization[[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Database_normalizat
ion&action=edit&section=4]edit]

   Normalization is a database design technique, which is used to design a
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database]relational database
   table up to higher normal
   form.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#cite_note-9
   ][9] The process is progressive, and a higher level of database
   normalization cannot be achieved unless the previous levels have been
   satisfied.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#cite_n
   ote-:0-10][10]

   That means that, having data in
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unnormalized_form]unnormalized form (the
   least normalized) and aiming to achieve the highest level of
   normalization, the first step would be to ensure compliance to
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form]first normal form, the
   second step would be to ensure
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_normal_form]second normal form is
   satisfied, and so forth in order mentioned above, until the data
   conform to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_normal_form]sixth
   normal form.

   However, it is worth noting that normal forms beyond
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4NF]4NF are mainly of academic interest,
   as the problems they exist to solve rarely appear in
   practice.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#cite_no
   te-11][11]

   The data in the following example were intentionally designed to
   contradict most of the normal forms. In practice it is often possible
   to skip some of the normalization steps because the data is already
   normalized to some extent. Fixing a violation of one normal form also
   often fixes a violation of a higher normal form. In the example, one
   table has been chosen for normalization at each step, meaning that at
   the end, some tables might not be sufficiently normalized.

   The Book table below has a

   some subset of that key is a determinant. At this point in our design
   the key is not finalised as the

   a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_key]candidate key. Consider

   All of the attributes that are not part of the candidate key depend on
   Title, but only Price also depends on Format. To conform to

   duplicates, every non-candidate-key attribute must depend on the whole
   candidate key, not just part of it.

   To normalize this table, make {Title} a (simple) candidate key (the
   primary key) so that every non-candidate-key attribute depends on the
   whole candidate key, and remove Price into a separate table so that its
   dependency on Format can be preserved:

   A similar violation exists for genre ({Genre Name} is dependent on

   Main article:
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_key_normal_form]Elementary
   key normal form

   The elementary key normal form (EKNF) falls strictly between 3NF and
   BCNF and is not much discussed in the literature. It is intended "to
   capture the salient qualities of both 3NF and BCNF" while avoiding the
   problems of both (namely, that 3NF is "too forgiving" and BCNF is
   "prone to computational complexity"). Since it is rarely mentioned in
   literature, it is not included in this example.

   Assume the database is owned by a book retailer franchise that has
   several franchisees that own shops in different locations. And
   therefore the retailer decided to add a table that contains data about
   availability of the books at different locations:

   As this table structure consists of a
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_key]compound primary key, it
   doesn't contain any non-key attributes and it's already in
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce%E2%80%93Codd_normal_form]BCNF (and
   therefore also satisfies all the previous
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms]norm
   al forms). However, assuming that all available books are offered in
   each area, the Title is not unambiguously bound to a certain Location
   and therefore the table doesn't satisfy
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form]4NF.

   That means that, to satisfy the
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form]fourth normal form,
   this table needs to be decomposed as well:

   To spot a table not satisfying the
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_normal_form]5NF, it is usually
   necessary to examine the data thoroughly. Suppose the table from
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Satisfying_4NF]4N
   F example with a little modification in data and let's examine if it
   satisfies [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_normal_form]5NF:

   2 The Relational Model for Database Management: Version 2 California

   Decomposing this table lowers redundancies, resulting in the following
   two tables:

   CAPTION: Franchisee - Book

   Franchisee ID                          Title

   The query joining these tables would return the following data:

   The JOIN returns three more rows than it should; adding another table
   to clarify the relation results in three separate tables:

   What will the JOIN return now? It actually is not possible to join
   these three tables. That means it wasn't possible to decompose the
   Franchisee - Book - Location without data loss, therefore the table
   already satisfies [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5NF]5NF.

   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_J._Date]C.J. Date has argued
   that only a database in 5NF is truly
   "normalized".^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#cit
   e_note-13][13]

Satisfying
DKNF[[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Database_normalization&actio
n=edit&section=13]edit]

   Let's have a look at the Book table from previous examples and see if
   it satisfies the
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-key_normal_form]Domain-key normal
   form:

   CAPTION: Book

   Title Pages Thickness Genre ID Publisher ID
   Beginning MySQL Database Design and Optimization 520 Thick 1 1
   The Relational Model for Database Management: Version 2 538 Thick 2 2
   Learning SQL 338 Slim 1 3
   SQL Cookbook 636 Thick 1 3

   Logically, Thickness is determined by number of pages. That means it
   depends on Pages which is not a key. Let's set an example convention
   saying a book up to 350 pages is considered "slim" and a book over 350
   pages is considered "thick".

   This convention is technically a constraint but it is neither a domain
   constraint nor a key constraint; therefore we cannot rely on domain
   constraints and key constraints to keep the data integrity.

   In other words – nothing prevents us from putting, for example, "Thick"
   for a book with only 50 pages – and this makes the table violate
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-key_normal_form]DKNF.

   To solve this, a table holding enumeration that defines the Thickness
   is created, and that column is removed from the original table:

   CAPTION: Thickness Enum

   Thickness Min pages    Max pages
   Slim      1         350

   That way, the domain integrity violation has been eliminated, and the
   table is in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-key_normal_form]DKNF.

Satisfying
6NF[[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Database_normalization&action
=edit&section=14]edit]

   A simple and intuitive definition of the
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_normal_form]sixth normal form is
   that "a table is in
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_normal_form]6NF when the row
   contains the Primary Key, and at most one other
   attribute".^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#cite_
   note-14][14]

   That means, for example, the Publisher table designed while
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Satisfying_1NF]cr
   eating the 1NF

   CAPTION: Publisher

   Publisher ID  Name  Country
   1            Apress USA

   needs to be further decomposed into two tables:

   CAPTION: Publisher

   Publisher ID  Name
   1            Apress

   CAPTION: Publisher country

   Publisher ID Country
   1            USA

   The obvious drawback of 6NF is the proliferation of tables required to
   represent the information on a single entity. If a table in 5NF has one
   primary key column and N attributes, representing the same information
   in 6NF will require N tables; multi-field updates to a single
   conceptual record will require updates to multiple tables; and inserts
   and deletes will similarly require operations across multiple tables.
   For this reason, in databases intended to serve
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLTP]Online Transaction Processing
   needs, 6NF should not be used.

   However, in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouses]data
   warehouses, which do not permit interactive updates and which are
   specialized for fast query on large data volumes, certain DBMSs use an
   internal 6NF representation – known as a
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS]columnar data
   store. In situations where the number of unique values of a column is
   far less than the number of rows in the table, column-oriented storage
   allow significant savings in space through data compression. Columnar
   storage also allows fast execution of range queries (e.g., show all
   records where a particular column is between X and Y, or less than X.)

   In all these cases, however, the database designer does not have to
   perform 6NF normalization manually by creating separate tables. Some
   DBMSs that are specialized for warehousing, such as
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybase_IQ]Sybase IQ, use columnar
   storage by default, but the designer still sees only a single
   multi-column table. Other DBMSs, such as Microsoft SQL Server 2012 and
   later, let you specify a "columnstore index" for a particular
   table.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#cite_note-

       "The adoption of a relational model of data ... permits the
       development of a universal data sub-language based on an applied
       predicate calculus. A first-order predicate calculus suffices if
       the collection of relations is in normal form. Such a language
       would provide a yardstick of linguistic power for all other
       proposed data languages, and would itself be a strong candidate for
       embedding (with appropriate syntactic modification) in a variety of
       host languages (programming, command- or problem-oriented)." Codd,
