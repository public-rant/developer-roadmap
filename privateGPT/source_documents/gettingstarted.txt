Python For Beginners

   Welcome! Are you
   [http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers]completely
   new to programming? If not then we presume you will be looking for
   information about why and how to get started with Python. Fortunately
   an experienced programmer in any programming language (whatever it may
   be) can pick up Python very quickly. It's also easy for beginners to
   use and learn, so
   [http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers]jump in!

Installing

   Installing Python is generally easy, and nowadays many Linux and UNIX
   distributions include a recent Python. Even some Windows computers
   (notably those from HP) now come with Python already installed. If you
   do need to install Python and aren't confident about the task you can
   find a few notes on the
   [http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download]BeginnersGuide/Dow
   nload wiki page, but installation is unremarkable on most platforms.

Learning

   Before getting started, you may want to find out which
   [http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments]IDEs and
   [http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors]text editors are tailored to
   make Python editing easy, browse the list of
   [http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntroductoryBooks]introductory books, or
   look at [http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Examples]code
   samples that you might find helpful.

   There is a list of tutorials suitable for experienced programmers on
   the
   [http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers]BeginnersGuide/
   Tutorials page. There is also a list of
   [https://www.python.org/doc/nonenglish/]resources in other languages
   which might be useful if English is not your first language.

   The [http://docs.python.org/]online documentation is your first port of
   call for definitive information. There is a fairly brief
   [http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/]tutorial that gives you basic
   information about the language and gets you started. You can follow
   this by looking at the [http://docs.python.org/3/library/]library
   reference for a full description of Python's many libraries and the
   [http://docs.python.org/3/reference/]language reference for a complete
   (though somewhat dry) explanation of Python's syntax. If you are
   looking for common Python recipes and patterns, you can browse the
   [http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/]ActiveState Python
   Cookbook

Looking for Something Specific?

   If you want to know whether a particular application, or a library with
   particular functionality, is available in Python there are a number of
   possible sources of information. The Python web site provides a
   [http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=index]Python Package Index (also
   known as the Cheese Shop, a reference to the Monty Python script of
   that name). There is also a [https://www.python.org/search]search page
   for a number of sources of Python-related information. Failing that,
   just [http://www.google.com/]Google for a phrase including the word
   ''python'' and you may well get the result you need. If all else fails,
   ask on the [news:comp.lang.python]python newsgroup and there's a good
   chance someone will put you on the right track.

Frequently Asked Questions

   If you have a question, it's a good idea to try the
   [http://docs.python.org/3/faq/]FAQ, which answers the most commonly
   asked questions about Python.

Looking to Help?

   If you want to help to develop Python, take a look at the
   [https://www.python.org/dev/]developer area for further information.
   Please note that you don't have to be an expert programmer to help. The
   documentation is just as important as the compiler, and still needs
   plenty of work!
