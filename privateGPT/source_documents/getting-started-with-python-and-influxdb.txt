   Rahul Banerjee
   Rahul Banerjee is a computer engineering student who likes playing
   around with different libraries/APIs.

   Although time-series data can be stored in a MySQL or PostgreSQL
   database, that’s not particularly efficient. If you want to store data
   that changes every minute (that’s more than half a million data points
   a year!) from potentially thousands of different sensors, servers,
   containers, or devices, you’re inevitably going to run into scalability
   issues. Querying or performing aggregation on this data also leads to
   performance issues when using relational databases.

   A time-series database (TSDB), on the other hand, is optimized to store
   time-series data points. This is particularly useful in situations
   like:
     * Analyzing financial trends in stock prices.
     * Sales forecasting.
     * Monitoring the logs and metrics of an API or web service.
     * Monitoring the sensor data from a car or a plane for safety
       purposes.
     * Tracking power usage in IoT devices such as a smart power grid.
     * Tracking an athlete’s vitals and performance during a game.

   [https://www.influxdata.com/]InfluxDB has created an open source
   [https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-database/]time-series database
   that makes it easier for developers to work with
   [https://www.influxdata.com/what-is-time-series-data/]time-series data.
   This article will show you how to set up InfluxDB using Python, working
   with stock data fetched using the Yahoo Finance API.

   You can access all the code written in this tutorial in
   [https://github.com/rahulbanerjee26/InfluxDB-Tutorial]this repo.
   [https://www.influxdata.com/?utm_content=sponsormodule]InfluxData is
   the creator of InfluxDB, the leading time series platform used to
   collect, store, and analyze all time series data at any scale.
   Developers can query and analyze their time-stamped data in real-time
   to discover, interpret, and share new insights to gain a competitive
   edge.

   The latest from InfluxData

Why Use InfluxDB?

   InfluxDB comes with a pre-built dashboard where you can analyze your
   time series data without much groundwork. And let’s not forget that it
   [https://www.influxdata.com/products/compare/]outperforms Elasticsearch
   and Cassandra.

   It has a free open source version you can run locally, and there’s a
   cloud version that
   [https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-cloud/]supports major
   cloud services such as AWS, GCP and Azure.

Setting up InfluxDB with Python

   Before getting started, make sure you have
   [https://www.python.org/downloads/]Python 3.6 or later installed on
   your computer. You’ll also need a virtual environment. This article
   uses [https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv]venv, but
   you can use conda, pipenv or pyenv as well.

   Finally, some experience with
   [https://docs.influxdata.com/flux/v0.x/get-started/]Flux querying.

   This guide uses the module
   [https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-python]influxdb-client-p
   ython to interact with InfluxDB. The library only supports InfluxDB 2.x
   and InfluxDB 1.8+, and it requires Python 3.6 or later.

   All set? Let’s get started installing and connecting the client
   library.

   If you have Docker installed on your computer, you can simply run
   InfluxDB’s Docker Image using the following command:

   bash________________________________________________________
   docker run --name influxdb -p 8086:8086 influxdb:2.1.0______
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   1
   2
   bash
   docker run --name influxdb -p 8086:8086 influxdb:2.1.0

   If you don’t have Docker,
   [https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.1/install/]download the
   software for your OS here and install it. If you’re running InfluxDB on
   a Mac, you can use Homebrew to install it:

   bash________________________________________________________
   brew install influxdb_______________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   1
   2
   bash
   brew install influxdb

   If you’re running the Docker image, you can directly go to
   [http://localhost:8086/]localhost 8086. However, if you downloaded the
   software and installed it, you will need to enter the following in the
   command line:

   bash________________________________________________________
   influxd_____________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   1
   2
   bash
   influxd

   You should see the following screen on localhost 8086:

   Screen shot of welcome page

   Click **Get Started**, which redirects you to the following page:

   Screenshot of the next page after the welcome message

   For this tutorial, choose **Quick Start** and enter your information on
   this page:

   Screenshot of setup initial user page

   You can create organizations and buckets later on as well, but for now,
   just pick an easy name for each of these fields.

   After signing up, you should find yourself on the dashboard page. Click
   **Load your data** and then choose the **Python** client library.

   Screenshot of load data screen

   You should now see the below screen:

   Screenshot of code sample options

   Under **Token**, there should already be a token listed. However, if
   you’d like, you can generate a new token for this tutorial. Click
   **Generate Token** and select **All Access Token** since you will be
   updating and deleting data later in the tutorial.

   Note that InfluxDB will raise a warning at this point, but you can
   ignore it for now.

   Screenshot of generate all access token

   Now, you’ll have to set up a Python virtual environment. Create a new
   folder for the tutorial:

   bash________________________________________________________
   mkdir influxDB-Tutorial_____________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   1
   2
   bash
   mkdir influxDB-Tutorial

   Then change your directory into the new folder:

   bash________________________________________________________
   cd influxDB-Tutorial________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   1
   2
   bash
   cd influxDB-Tutorial

   Create a virtual environment:

   bash________________________________________________________
   python3 -m venv venv________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   1
   2
   bash
   python3 -m venv venv

   Activate it.

   bash________________________________________________________
   source venv/bin/activate____________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   1
   2
   bash
   source venv/bin/activate

   Finally, install InfluxDB’s client library:

   bash________________________________________________________
   pip install influxdb-client_________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   1
   2
   bash
   pip install influxdb-client

   Create a new file named __init.py__, then go back to the InfluxDB UI:

   Select the appropriate token and bucket, then copy the code snippet
   under **Initialize the Client** and paste it in your Python file. The
   code snippet will be automatically updated if you change your
   token/bucket selection.

   Next, run your Python file:

   bash________________________________________________________
   python3 __init__.py_________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   1
   2
   bash
   python3 __init__.py

   If no error messages are shown in the terminal, you have successfully
   connected to InfluxDB.

   To follow best practices, you can store your credentials in an .env
   file. Create a file named .env and store the following information:

   bash________________________________________________________
   TOKEN = 'YOUR TOKEN'________________________________________
   ORG = 'YOUR ORG NAME'_______________________________________
   BUCKET = 'YOUR BUCKET NAME'_________________________________
   1
   2
   3
   4
   bash
   TOKEN = 'YOUR TOKEN'
   ORG = 'YOUR ORG NAME'
   BUCKET = 'YOUR BUCKET NAME'

   Then install the python-dotenv module to read the .env variables:

   bash________________________________________________________
   pip3 install python-dotenv__________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   1
   2
   bash
   pip3 install python-dotenv

   Finally, update your Python file to load the data from the .env file:

   Note that you will need to change the url parameter if you are using an
   InfluxDB Cloud account. The URL will depend on which cloud region you
   chose. The cloud URLs can be found in the docs here.

   The lines that are importing the DateTime module and the InfluxDB
   library will be required later on in the tutorial. It’s a good practice
   to have all your import statements together at the beginning. However,
   if you choose to, you can import them when necessary as well.

   Alternatively, you can store your credentials in a file with the
   extension .ini or .toml and use the from_config_file function to
   [https://influxdb-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#influxdb_cli
   ent.InfluxDBClient.from_config_file]connect to InfluxDB.

CRUD Operations with influxdb-client-python

   This article used the
   [https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/]yfinance module in Python to gather
   some historical stock data. Install it using the following command:

   bash________________________________________________________
   pip install yfinance________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   1
   2
   bash
   pip install yfinance

   You can use the following code snippet to get the data:

   python______________________________________________________
   import yfinance as yf_______________________________________
   data = yf.download("MSFT", start="2021-01-01", end="2021-10-
   print(data.to_csv())________________________________________
   1
   2
   3
   4
   python
   import yfinance as yf
   data = yf.download("MSFT", start="2021-01-01", end="2021-10-30")
   print(data.to_csv())

   Make sure to pass a filename parameter to the to_csv method; this will
   store the CSV locally so you can read the data later.

   Alternatively, you can get the CSV file from the
   [https://github.com/rahulbanerjee26/InfluxDB-Tutorial/blob/main/Data/MS
   FT.csv]GitHub repo.

   Next, create a class and add the CRUD operations as its methods:

   If you are using a cloud instance of InfluxDB, you will want to replace
   the URL parameter with the proper
   [https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/reference/regions/]cloud
   region.

   To create an instance of the class, use this command:

   python______________________________________________________
   IC = InfluxClient(token,org,bucket)_________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   1
   2
   python
   IC = InfluxClient(token,org,bucket)

Write Data

   InfluxDBClient has a method called write_api which is used to write
   data into your database. Below is the code snippet for this method:

   InfluxDBClient supports asynchronous and synchronous writes, and you
   can specify the write type as required. For more information about
   asynchronous writes, see
   “[https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-python#how-to-use-async
   io]How to use Asyncio in influxdb-client.”

   The data parameter can be written in three different ways, as shown
   below:

Line Protocol String


   python______________________________________________________
   # Data Write Method 1_______________________________________
   IC.write_data(["MSFT,stock=MSFT Open=62.79,High=63.84,Low=62
   ____________________________________________________________
   1
   2
   3
   python
   # Data Write Method 1
   IC.write_data(["MSFT,stock=MSFT Open=62.79,High=63.84,Low=62.13"])

   Note that the string has to follow a particular format:

   measurementName,tagKey=tagValue fieldKey1="fieldValue1",fiel
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   1
   measurementName,tagKey=tagValue
   fieldKey1="fieldValue1",fieldKey2=fieldValue2 timestamp

   There’s a space between the tagValue and the first fieldKey, and
   another space between the last fieldValue and timeStamp. While parsing,
   these spaces are used as separators; therefore, you have to format it
   in the manner shown above. Note also that in this case I assumed that
   the first field value, fieldValue1, is a string, while fieldValue2 is a
   number. Therefore, fieldValue1 should appear in quotes.

   Note also that the timestamp is optional. If no timestamp is provided,
   InfluxDB uses the system time (UTC) of its host machine. You can read
   more about
   [https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.1/reference/syntax/line-protoc
   ol/]Line Protocol here.

   .field("Low",62.13)
   .time(int(datetime.strptime('2021-11-07','%Y-%m-%d').timestamp()))
   ],
   )

   If you do not want to deal with the format in the Line Protocol String,
   you can use the Point() Class. This ensures that your data is properly
   serialized into line protocol.

   IC.write_data([
   {
   "measurement": "MSFT",
   "tags": {"stock": "MSFT"},
   "fields": {
   "Open": 62.79,
   "High": 63.38,
   "Low": 62.13,
   },
   "time": int(datetime.strptime('2021-11-07','%Y-%m-%d').timestamp())
   },
   {
   "measurement": "MSFT_DATE",
   "tags": {"stock": "MSFT"},
   "fields": {
   "Open": 62.79,
   "High": 63.38,
   "Low": 62.13,
   },
   }
   ],write_option=ASYNCHRONOUS)

   In this method, you’re passing two data points and setting the write
   option to ASYNCHRONOUS. This is Python-friendly, since the data is
   passed as a dictionary.

   All the different ways to write the data are consolidated in the below
   gist:

   Next, insert all the data for the MSFT stock and the AAPL stock. Since
   the data is stored in a CSV file, you can use the first method — Line
   Protocol String — to write the data:

   You can insert the data for the AAPL stock by changing the file path
   and strings from MSFT to AAPL:

   python3_____________________________________________________
   AAPL_file = open('Data/AAPL.csv')___________________________
   csvreader = csv.reader(AAPL_file)___________________________
   ____________________________________________________________
   1
   2
   3
   python3
   AAPL_file = open('Data/AAPL.csv')
   csvreader = csv.reader(AAPL_file)

Reading the Data

   InfluxDBClient also has a method called query_api that can be used to
   read data. You can use queries for various purposes, such as filtering
   your data based on a specific date, aggregating your data within a time
   range, finding the highest/lowest values in a time range, and more.
   They are similar to queries you would use in SQL. You’ll need to use
   queries when reading data from InfluxDB.

   The following code is for our class’s read method:

   Here, it accepts a query and then executes it. The return value of the
   query is a collection of Flux Objects that match your query. The Flux
   Object has the following methods:

   .get_measurement()__________________________________________
   .get_field()________________________________________________
   .values.get(“<your tags>”)__________________________________
   .get_time()_________________________________________________

   .get_measurement()
   .get_field()
   .values.get(“<your tags>”)
   .get_time()

   Two query examples are shown below that demonstrate the query_data
   function in action. The first query returns the high value for MSFT
   stock since Oct. 1, 2021, and the second query returns the high value
   for the MSFT stock on 2021-10-29.

   Make sure you change the bucket name in the beginning of the query as
   needed. In my case, my bucket name is *TestBucket*.

Updating the Data

   Unlike the Write and Query APIs, InfluxDB does not have an Update API.
   The statement below is taken from their
   [https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.1/write-data/best-practices/du
   plicate-points/]documentation about how they handle duplicate data
   points.

   For points that have the same measurement name, tag set, and timestamp,
   InfluxDB creates a union of the old and new fieldsets. For any matching
   field keys, InfluxDB uses the field value of the new point

   To update a data point, you need to have the name, tag set, and
   timestamp and simply perform a write operation.

Deleting Data

   You can delete data using delete_api. Below is some code demonstrating
   how to delete data:

   Delete functions require the measurement value of the data point. The
   following code shows a simple use case of the delete function:

   InfluxDB’s documentation includes a
   [https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.1/write-data/best-practices/]l
   ist of best practices for writing data. There are also some
   [https://www.influxdata.com/blog/data-layout-and-schema-design-best-pra
   ctices-for-influxdb/]best practices for data layout and schema design,
   which you should follow for the best results.

Some Practical Use Cases of Time Series Databases

   This article examined a simple use case of a TSDB to store stock
   values, so you could analyze historical stock prices and forecast
   future values. However, you could also work with IoT Devices, sales
   data, and any other data series which is time-varying.

   Some other practical use cases include:

Conclusion

   Hopefully, this guide empowered you to set up your own instance of
   InfluxDB. You learned how to build a simple app to perform CRUD
   Operations using InfluxDB’s Python client library, but if you want to
   take a closer look at anything, you can find the
   [https://github.com/rahulbanerjee26/InfluxDB-Tutorial/blob/main/__init_
   _.py]repo with the entire source code here.

   Check out [https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-database/]InfluxDB’s
   open source TSDB. It’s got client libraries for ten programming
   languages including Python, C++, and JavaScript, and it’s also got a
   lot of built-in visualization tools so you can see exactly what your
   data is doing.
