What is an API?

   APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate
   with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example,
   the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The
   weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you
   daily weather updates on your phone.

What does API stand for?

   API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of
   APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct
   function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between
   two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with
   each other using requests and responses. Their API documentation
   contains information on how developers are to structure those requests
   and responses.

How do APIs work?

   API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server.
   The application sending the request is called the client, and the
   application sending the response is called the server. So in the
   weather example, the bureau’s weather database is the server, and the
   mobile app is the client.

   There are four different ways that APIs can work depending on when and
   why they were created.

SOAP APIs

   These APIs use Simple Object Access Protocol. Client and server
   exchange messages using XML. This is a less flexible API that was more
   popular in the past.

RPC APIs

   These APIs are called Remote Procedure Calls. The client completes a
   function (or procedure) on the server, and the server sends the output
   back to the client.

Websocket APIs

   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigatewa
   y-websocket-api-overview?pg=wianapi&cta=websocketapi]Websocket API is
   another modern web API development that uses JSON objects to pass data.
   A WebSocket API supports two-way communication between client apps and
   the server. The server can send callback messages to connected clients,
   making it more efficient than REST API.

REST APIs

   These are the most popular and flexible APIs found on the web today.
   The client sends requests to the server as data. The server uses this
   client input to start internal functions and returns output data back
   to the client. Let’s look at REST APIs in more detail below.

What are REST APIs?

   REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST defines a set of
   functions like GET, PUT, DELETE, etc. that clients can use to access
   server data. Clients and servers exchange data using HTTP.

   The main feature
   of [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-a
   pi-vs-rest?pg=wianapi&cta=restapi]REST API is statelessness.
   Statelessness means that servers do not save client data between
   requests. Client requests to the server are similar to URLs you type in
   your browser to visit a website. The response from the server is plain
   data, without the typical graphical rendering of a web page.

What is web API?

   A Web API or Web Service API is an application processing interface
   between a web server and web browser. All web services are APIs but not
   all APIs are web services. REST API is a special type of Web API that
   uses the standard architectural style explained above.

   The different terms around APIs, like Java API or service APIs, exist
   because historically, APIs were created before the world wide web.
   Modern web APIs are REST APIs and the terms can be used
   interchangeably.

What are API integrations?

   API integrations are software components that automatically update data
   between clients and servers. Some examples of API integrations are when
   automatic data sync to the cloud from your phone image gallery, or the
   time and date automatically sync on your laptop when you travel to
   another time zone. Enterprises can also use them to efficiently
   automate many system functions.

What are the benefits of REST APIs?

   REST APIs offer four main benefits:

1. Integration

   APIs are used to integrate new applications with existing software
   systems. This increases development speed because each functionality
   doesn’t have to be written from scratch. You can use APIs to leverage
   existing code.

2. Innovation

   Entire industries can change with the arrival of a new app. Businesses
   need to respond quickly and support the rapid deployment of innovative
   services. They can do this by making changes at the API level without
   having to re-write the whole code.

3. Expansion

   APIs present a unique opportunity for businesses to meet their clients’
   needs across different platforms. For example, maps API allows map
   information integration via websites, Android,iOS, etc. Any business
   can give similar access to their internal databases by using free or
   paid APIs.

4. Ease of maintenance

   The API acts as a gateway between two systems. Each system is obliged
   to make internal changes so that the API is not impacted. This way, any
   future code changes by one party do not impact the other party.

What are the different types of APIs?

   APIs are classified both according to their architecture and scope of
   use. We have already explored the main types of API architectures so
   let’s take a look at the scope of use.

Private APIs

   These are internal to an enterprise and only used for connecting
   systems and data within the business.

Public APIs

   These are open to the public and may be used by anyone. There may or
   not be some authorization and cost associated with these types of APIs.

Partner APIs

   These are only accessible by authorized external developers to aid
   business-to-business partnerships.

Composite APIs

   These combine two or more different APIs to address complex system
   requirements or behaviors.

What is an API endpoint and why is it important?

   API endpoints are the final touchpoints in the API communication
   system. These include server URLs, services, and other specific digital
   locations from where information is sent and received between systems.
   API endpoints are critical to enterprises for two main reasons:

1. Security

   API endpoints make the system vulnerable to attack. API monitoring is
   crucial for preventing misuse.

2. Performance

   API endpoints, especially high traffic ones, can cause bottlenecks and
   affect system performance.

How to secure a REST API?

   All APIs must be secured through proper authentication and monitoring.
   The two main ways to secure REST APIs include:

1. Authentication tokens

   These are used to authorize users to make the API call. Authentication
   tokens check that the users are who they claim to be and that they have
   access rights for that particular API call. For example, when you log
   in to your email server, your email client uses authentication tokens
   for secure access.

2. API keys

   API keys verify the program or application making the API call. They
   identify the application and ensure it has the access rights required
   to make the particular API call. API keys are not as secure as tokens
   but they allow API monitoring in order to gather data on usage. You may
   have noticed a long string of characters and numbers in your browser
   URL when you visit different websites. This string is an API key the
   website uses to make internal API calls.

How to create an API?

   Due diligence and effort are required to build an API that other
   developers will want to work with and trust. These are the five steps
   required for high-quality API design:

1. Plan the API

   API specifications, like OpenAPI, provide the blueprint for your API
   design. It is better to think about different use cases in advance and
   ensure the API adheres to current API development standards.

2. Build the API

    API designers prototype APIs using boilerplate code. Once the
   prototype is tested, developers can customize it to internal
   specifications.

3. Test the API

   API testing is the same as software testing and must be done to prevent
   bugs and defects. API testing tools can be used to strength test the
   API against cyber attacks.

4. Document the API

   While APIs are self-explanatory, API documentation acts as a guide to
   improve usability. Well-documented APIs that offer a range of functions
   and use cases tend to be more popular in a service-oriented
   architecture.

5. Market the API

   Just as Amazon is an online marketplace for retail, API marketplaces
   exist for developers to buy and sell other APIs. Listing your API can
   allow you to monetize it.

What is API testing?

   API testing strategies are similar to other software testing
   methodologies. The main focus is on validating server responses. API
   testing includes:
     * Making multiple requests to API endpoints for performance testing.
     * Writing unit tests for checking business logic and functional
       correctness.
     * Security testing by simulating system attacks.

How to write API documentation?

   Writing comprehensive API documentation is part of
   the [https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/api-management/?pg=wianapi&cta=
   apimgtprcs]API management process. API documentation can be
   auto-generated using tools or written manually. Some best practices
   include:
     * Writing explanations in simple, easy-to-read English. Documents
       generated by tools can become wordy and require editing.
     * Using code samples to explain functionality.
     * Maintaining the documentation so it is accurate and up-to-date.
     * Aiming the writing style at beginners
     * Covering all the problems the API can solve for the users.

How to use an API?

   The steps to implement a new API include:
    1. Obtaining an API key. This is done by creating a verified account
       with the API provider.
    2. Set up an HTTP API client. This tool allows you to structure API
       requests easily using the API keys received.
    3. If you don’t have an API client, you can try to structure the
       request yourself in your browser by referring to the API
       documentation.
    4. Once you are comfortable with the new API syntax, you can start
       using it in your code.

Where can I find new APIs?

   New web APIs can be found on API marketplaces and API directories. API
   marketplaces are open platforms where anyone can list an API for sale.
   API directories are controlled repositories regulated by the directory
   owner. Expert API designers may assess and test a new API before adding
   it to their directory.

   Some popular API websites include:
     * Rapid API – The largest global API market with over 10,000 public
       APIs and 1 million active developers on site. RapidAPI allows users
       to test APIs directly on the platform before committing to
       purchase.
     * Public APIs – The platform groups remote APIs into 40 niche
       categories, making it easier to browse and find the right one to
       meet your needs.
     * APIForThat and APIList – Both these websites have lists of 500+ web
       APIs, along with in-depth information on how to use them.

What is an API gateway?

   An API Gateway is an API management tool for enterprise clients that
   use a broad range of back-end services. API gateways typically handle
   common tasks like user authentication, statistics, and rate management
   that are applicable across all API calls.

   [https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/?pg=wianapi&cta=amzapigtwy]Amazon
   API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for
   developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at
   any scale. It handles all the tasks involved in accepting and
   processing thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic
   management, CORS support, authorization, and access control,
   throttling, monitoring, and API version management.

What is GraphQL?

   GraphQL is a query language that was developed specifically for APIs.
   It prioritizes giving clients exactly the data they request and no
   more. It is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and
   developer-friendly. As an alternative to REST, GraphQL gives front-end
   developers the ability to query multiple databases, microservices, and
   APIs with a single GraphQL endpoint. Organizations choose to build APIs
   with GraphQL because it helps them develop applications
   faster. [https://aws.amazon.com/graphql/]Read more about GraphQL here.

   AWS AppSync is a fully managed service that makes it easy to develop
   GraphQL APIs by handling the heavy lifting of securely connecting to
   data sources like AWS DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and more AWS AppSync can
   push real-time data updates over Websockets to millions of clients. For
   mobile and web applications, AppSync also provides local data access
   when devices go offline. Once deployed, AWS AppSync automatically
   scales GraphQL API execution engine up and down to meet API request
   volumes.
