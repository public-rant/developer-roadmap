   System design is one of the most important rounds of interviews for
   software engineers in big tech companies. There are a lot of concepts
   an engineer should be aware of and database sharding is one of them.
   Whenever any application starts receiving a huge amount of concurrent
   requests and it sees significant growth of the users on the website it
   eventually needs to scale to handle the increasing amount of data or
   traffic on the website. It’s difficult to predict the growth of the
   website in the future, and we can’t predict how long a website will
   maintain its popularity and growth. So we need to scale our database
   dynamically and database sharding is the technique that can fulfill
   this job. Let’s understand this concept in detail.

   Database sharding is a technique for horizontal scaling of databases,
   where the data is split across multiple database instances, or shards,
   to improve performance and reduce the impact of large amounts of data
   on a single database.
    1. Sharding can be used in system design interviews to help
       demonstrate a candidate’s understanding of scalability and database
       design. When designing a sharded database, the following key
       considerations should be taken into account:
    2. Data distribution: How the data will be split across the shards,
       either based on a specific key such as the user ID or by using a
       hash function.
    3. Shard rebalancing: How the data will be balanced across the shards
       as the amount of data changes over time.
    4. Query routing: How queries will be directed to the correct shard,
       either by using a dedicated routing layer or by including the shard
       information in the query.
    5. Data consistency: How data consistency will be maintained across
       the shards, for example by using transaction logs or by employing a
       distributed database system.
    6. Failure handling: How the system will handle the failure of one or
       more shards, including data recovery and data redistribution.
    7. Performance: How the sharded database will perform in terms of read
       and write speed, as well as overall system performance and
       scalability.

   In summary, database sharding is a complex but important concept in
   system design that can help to improve the scalability and performance
   of a database-driven system. A strong understanding of database
   sharding is often viewed as a key requirement for successful system
   design.

   Database-Sharding-In-System-Design

What is Sharding or Data Partitioning?

   Take the example of Pizza (yes!!! your favorite food). You get the
   pizza in different slices and you share these slices with your friends.
   Sharding which is also known as data partitioning works on the same
   concept of sharing the Pizza slices. It is basically a database
   architecture pattern in which we split a large dataset into smaller
   chunks (logical shards) and we store/distribute these chunks in
   different machines/database nodes (physical shards). Each
   chunk/partition is known as a “shard” and each shard has the same
   database schema as the original database. We distribute the data in
   such a way that each row appears in exactly one shard. It’s a good
   mechanism to improve the scalability of an application.

   Sharding

     Database shards are autonomous; they don’t share any of the same
     data or computing resources. In some cases, though, it may make
     sense to replicate certain tables into each shard to serve as
     reference tables.

Advantages of Sharding

     * Solve Scalability Issue: With a single database server architecture
       any application experience performance degradation when users start
       growing on that application.  Reads and write queries become slower
       and the network bandwidth starts to saturate.  At some point, you
       will be running out of disk space. Database sharding fixes all
       these issues by partitioning the data across multiple machines.
     * High Availability: A problem with single server architecture is
       that if an outage happens then the entire application will be
       unavailable which is not good for a website with more number of
       users. This is not the case with a sharded database. If an outage
       happens in sharded architecture, then only some specific shards
       will be down. All the other shards will continue the operation and
       the entire application won’t be unavailable for the users.
     * Speed Up Query Response Time: When you submit a query in an
       application with a large monolithic database and have no sharded
       architecture, it takes more time to find the result. It has to
       search every row in the table and that slows down the response time
       for the query you have given. This doesn’t happen in sharded
       architecture. In a sharded database a query has to go through fewer
       rows and you receive the response in less time.
     * More Write Bandwidth: For many applications writing is a major
       bottleneck. With no master database serializing writes sharded
       architecture allows you to write in parallel and increase your
       write throughput.
     * Scaling Out: Sharding a database facilitates horizontal scaling,
       known as scaling out. In horizontal scaling, you add more machines
       in the network and distribute the load on these machines for faster
       processing and response. This has many advantages. You can do more
       work simultaneously and you can handle high requests from the
       users, especially when writing data because there are parallel
       paths through your system. You can also load balance web servers
       that access shards over different network paths, which are
       processed by different CPUs, and use separate caches of RAM or disk
       IO paths to process work.

Disadvantages of Sharding

     * Adds Complexity in the System: You need to be careful while
       implementing a proper sharded database architecture in an
       application. It’s a complicated task and if it’s not implemented
       properly then you may lose the data or get corrupted tables in your
       database. You also need to manage the data from multiple shard
       locations instead of managing and accessing it from a single entry
       point. This may affect the workflow of your team which can be
       potentially disruptive to some teams.
     * Rebalancing Data: In a sharded database architecture, sometimes
       shards become unbalanced (when a shard outgrows other shards).
       Consider an example that you have two shards of a database. One
       shard store the name of the customers begins with letter A through
       M. Another shard store the name of the customer begins with the
       letters N through Z. If there are so many users with the letter L
       then shard one will have more data than shard two. This will affect
       the performance (slow down) of the application and it will stall
       out for a significant portion of your users. The A-M shard will
       become unbalance and it will be known as database hotspot. To
       overcome this problem and to rebalance the data you need to do
       re-sharding for even data distribution. Moving data from one shard
       to another shard is not a good idea because it requires a lot of
       downtimes.
     * Joining Data From Multiple Shards is Expensive: In a single
       database, joins can be performed easily to implement any
       functionalities. But in sharded architecture, you need to pull the
       data from different shards and you need to perform joins across
       multiple networked servers You can’t submit a single query to get
       the data from various shards. You need to submit multiple queries
       for each one of the shards, pull out the data, and join the data
       across the network. This is going to be a very expensive and
       time-consuming process. It adds latency to your system.
     * No Native Support: Sharding is not natively supported by every
       database engine. For example, PostgreSQL doesn’t include automatic
       sharding features, so there you have to do manual sharding. You
       need to follow the “roll-your-own” approach. It will be difficult
       for you to find the tips or documentation for sharding and
       troubleshoot the problem during the implementation of sharding.

Sharding Architectures

1. Key Based Sharding

   This technique is also known as hash-based sharding. Here, we take the
   value of an entity such as customer ID, customer email, IP address of a
   client, zip code, etc and we use this value as an input of the hash
   function. This process generates a hash value which is used to
   determine which shard we need to use to store the data. We need to keep
   in mind that the values entered into the hash function should all come
   from the same column (shard key) just to ensure that data is placed in
   the correct order and in a consistent manner. Basically, shard keys act
   like a primary key or a unique identifier for individual rows.

   Consider an example that you have 3 database servers and each request
   has an application id which is incremented by 1 every time a new
   application is registered. To determine which server data should be
   placed on, we perform a modulo operation on these applications id with
   the number 3. Then the remainder is used to identify the server to
   store our data.

   Keybased-Sharding

   The downside of this method is elastic load balancing which means if
   you will try to add or remove the database servers dynamically it will
   be a difficult and expensive process. For example, in the above one if
   you will add 5 more servers then you need to add more corresponding
   hash values for the additional entries. Also, the majority of the
   existing keys need to be remapped to their new, correct hash value and
   then migrated to a new server. The hash function needs to be changed
   from modulo 3 to modulo 8. While the migration of data is in effect
   both the new and old hash functions won’t be valid. During the
   migration, your application won’t be able to service a large number of
   requests and you’ll experience downtime for your application till the
   migration completes.

   Note: A shard shouldn’t contain values that might change over time. It
   should be always static otherwise it will slow down the performance.

2. Horizontal or Range Based Sharding

   In this method, we split the data based on the ranges of a given value
   inherent in each entity. Let’s say you have a database of your online
   customers’ names and email information. You can split this information
   into two shards. In one shard you can keep the info of customers whose
   first name starts with A-P and in another shard, keep the information
   of the rest of the customers.

   Range-Based-Sharding

   Range-based sharding is the simplest sharding method to implement.
   Every shard holds a different set of data but they all have the same
   schema as the original database. In this method, you just need to
   identify in which range your data falls, and then you can store the
   entry to the corresponding shard. This method is best suitable for
   storing non-static data (example: storing the contact info for students
   in a college.)

   The drawback of this method is that the data may not be evenly
   distributed on shards. In the above example, you might have a lot of
   customers whose names fall into the category of A-P. In such cases, the
   first shard will have to take more load than the second one and it can
   become a system bottleneck.

3. Vertical Sharding

   In this method, we split the entire column from the table and we put
   those columns into new distinct tables. Data is totally independent of
   one partition to the other ones. Also, each partition holds both
   distinct rows and columns. Take the example of Twitter features. We can
   split different features of an entity in different shards on different
   machines. On Twitter users might have a profile, number of followers,
   and some tweets posted by his/her own. We can place the user profiles
   on one shard, followers in the second shard, and tweets on a third
   shard.

   Vertical-Sharding

   In this method, you can separate and handle the critical part (for
   example user profiles) non-critical part of your data (for example,
   blog posts) individually and build different replication and
   consistency models around it. This is one of the main advantages of
   this method.

   The main drawback of this scheme is that to answer some queries you may
   have to combine the data from different shards which unnecessarily
   increases the development and operational complexity of the system.
   Also, if your application will grow later and you add some more
   features in it then you will have to further shard a feature-specific
   database across multiple servers.

4. Directory-Based Sharding

   In this method, we create and maintain a lookup service or lookup table
   for the original database. Basically we use a shard key for lookup
   table and we do mapping for each entity that exists in the database.
   This way we keep track of which database shards hold which data.

   Directory-Based-Sharding

   The lookup table holds a static set of information about where specific
   data can be found. In the above image, you can see that we have used
   the delivery zone as a shard key. Firstly the client application
   queries the lookup service to find out the shard (database partition)
   on which the data is placed. When the lookup service returns the shard
   it queries/updates that shard.

   Directory-based sharding is much more flexible than range based and
   key-based sharding. In range-based sharding, you’re bound to specify
   the ranges of values. In key-based, you are bound to use a fixed hash
   function which is difficult to change later. In this approach, you’re
   free to use any algorithm you want to assign to data entries to shards.
   Also, it’s easy to add shards dynamically in this approach.

   The major drawback of this approach is the single point of failure of
   the lookup table. If it will be corrupted or failed then it will impact
   writing new data or accessing existing data from the table.

Conclusion

   Sharding is a great solution when the single database of your
   application is not capable to handle/store a huge amount of growing
   data. Sharding helps to scale the database and improve the performance
   of the application. However, it also adds some complexity to your
   system. The above methods and architectures have clearly shown the
   benefits and drawbacks of each sharding technique. So before you decide
   to choose any sharding method make sure you compare each one of them
   and depending on the type of information stored in the database, choose
   sharding or any one of the sharding techniques.
