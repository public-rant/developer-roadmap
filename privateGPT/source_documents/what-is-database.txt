What Is a Database?

Database defined

   A database is an organized collection of structured information, or
   data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database
   is usually controlled by a
   [https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/#WhatIsDBMS]database
   management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with
   the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a
   database system, often shortened to just database.

   Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is
   typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make
   processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily
   accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most
   databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying
   data.
   [https://www.oracle.com/database]Learn more about Oracle Database

What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?

   SQL is a programming language used by nearly all
   [https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/#relational]relationa
   l databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide
   access control. SQL was first developed at IBM in the 1970s with Oracle
   as a major contributor, which led to implementation of the SQL ANSI
   standard, SQL has spurred many extensions from companies such as IBM,
   Oracle, and Microsoft. Although SQL is still widely used today, new
   programming languages are beginning to appear.

Evolution of the database

   Databases have evolved dramatically since their inception in the early
   1960s. Navigational databases such as the hierarchical database (which
   relied on a tree-like model and allowed only a one-to-many
   relationship), and the network database (a more flexible model that
   allowed multiple relationships), were the original systems used to
   store and manipulate data. Although simple, these early systems were
   inflexible. In the 1980s,
   [https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/#relational]relationa
   l databases became popular, followed by
   [https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/#object-oriented]obje
   ct-oriented databases in the 1990s. More recently,
   [https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/#nosql]NoSQL
   databases came about as a response to the growth of the internet and
   the need for faster speed and processing of unstructured data. Today,
   [https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-a-cloud-database/]cloud
   databases and
   [https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/#autonomous]self-driv
   ing databases are breaking new ground when it comes to how data is
   collected, stored, managed, and utilized.

What’s the difference between a database and a spreadsheet?

   Databases and spreadsheets (such as Microsoft Excel) are both
   convenient ways to store information. The primary differences between
   the two are:
     * How the data is stored and manipulated
     * Who can access the data
     * How much data can be stored

   Spreadsheets were originally designed for one user, and their
   characteristics reflect that. They’re great for a single user or small
   number of users who don’t need to do a lot of incredibly complicated
   data manipulation. Databases, on the other hand, are designed to hold
   much larger collections of organized information—massive amounts,
   sometimes. Databases allow multiple users at the same time to quickly
   and securely access and query the data using highly complex logic and
   language.

Types of databases

   There are many different types of databases. The best database for a
   specific organization depends on how the organization intends to use
   the data.
   Relational databases
     * [https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-a-relational-database/]Rel
       ational databases became dominant in the 1980s. Items in a
       relational database are organized as a set of tables with columns
       and rows. Relational database technology provides the most
       efficient and flexible way to access structured information.
    Object-oriented databases
     * Information in an object-oriented database is represented in the
       form of objects, as in object-oriented programming.
    Distributed databases
     * A distributed database consists of two or more files located in
       different sites. The database may be stored on multiple computers,
       located in the same physical location, or scattered over different
       networks.
    Data warehouses
     * A central repository for data, a data warehouse is a type of
       database specifically designed for fast query and analysis.
    NoSQL databases
     * A [https://www.oracle.com/database/nosql/]NoSQL, or nonrelational
       database, allows unstructured and semistructured data to be stored
       and manipulated (in contrast to a relational database, which
       defines how all data inserted into the database must be composed).
       NoSQL databases grew popular as web applications became more common
       and more complex.
    Graph databases
     * A graph database stores data in terms of entities and the
       relationships between entities.
     * OLTP databases. An OLTP database is a speedy, analytic database
       designed for large numbers of transactions performed by multiple
       users.

   These are only a few of the several dozen types of databases in use
   today. Other, less common databases are tailored to very specific
   scientific, financial, or other functions. In addition to the different
   database types, changes in technology development approaches and
   dramatic advances such as the cloud and automation are propelling
   databases in entirely new directions. Some of the latest databases
   include
   Open source databases
     * An open source database system is one whose source code is open
       source; such databases could be SQL or NoSQL databases.
    Cloud databases
     * A [https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-a-cloud-database/]cloud
       database is a collection of data, either structured or
       unstructured, that resides on a private, public, or hybrid cloud
       computing platform. There are two types of cloud database models:
       traditional and database as a service (DBaaS). With DBaaS,
       administrative tasks and maintenance are performed by a service
       provider.
    Multimodel database
     * Multimodel databases combine different types of database models
       into a single, integrated back end. This means they can accommodate
       various data types.
    Document/JSON database
     * Designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented
       information,
       [https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/autonomous-json-databas
       e/]document databases are a modern way to store data in JSON format
       rather than rows and columns.
    Self-driving databases
     * The newest and most groundbreaking type of database, self-driving
       databases (also known as autonomous databases) are cloud-based and
       use machine learning to automate database tuning, security,
       backups, updates, and other routine management tasks traditionally
       performed by database administrators.

What is database software?

   Database software is used to create, edit, and maintain database files
   and records, enabling easier file and record creation, data entry, data
   editing, updating, and reporting. The software also handles data
   storage, backup and reporting, multi-access control, and security.
   Strong database security is especially important today, as data theft
   becomes more frequent. Database software is sometimes also referred to
   as a “database management system” (DBMS).

   Database software makes data management simpler by enabling users to
   store data in a structured form and then access it. It typically has a
   graphical interface to help create and manage the data and, in some
   cases, users can [https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/]construct
   their own databases by using database software.

What is a database management system (DBMS)?

   A database typically requires a comprehensive database software program
   known as a database management system (DBMS). A DBMS serves as an
   interface between the database and its end users or programs, allowing
   users to retrieve, update, and manage how the information is organized
   and optimized. A DBMS also facilitates oversight and control of
   databases, enabling a variety of administrative operations such as
   performance monitoring, tuning, and backup and recovery.

   Some examples of popular database software or DBMSs include MySQL,
   Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server, FileMaker Pro, Oracle Database,
   and dBASE.

What is a MySQL database?

   [https://www.oracle.com/mysql/]MySQL is an open source relational
   database management system based on SQL. It was designed and optimized
   for web applications and can run on any platform. As new and different
   requirements emerged with the internet, MySQL became the platform of
   choice for web developers and web-based applications. Because it’s
   designed to process millions of queries and thousands of transactions,
   MySQL is a popular choice for ecommerce businesses that need to manage
   multiple money transfers. On-demand flexibility is the primary feature
   of MySQL.

   MySQL is the DBMS behind some of the top websites and web-based
   applications in the world, including Airbnb, Uber, LinkedIn, Facebook,
   Twitter, and YouTube.

Using databases to improve business performance and decision-making

   With massive data collection from the Internet of Things transforming
   life and industry across the globe, businesses today have access to
   more data than ever before. Forward-thinking organizations can now use
   databases to go beyond basic data storage and transactions to analyze
   vast quantities of data from multiple systems. Using database and other
   computing and business intelligence tools, organizations can now
   leverage the data they collect to run more efficiently, enable better
   decision-making, and become more agile and scalable. Optimizing access
   and throughput to data is critical to businesses today because there is
   more data volume to track. It’s critical to have a
   [https://www.oracle.com/engineered-systems/exadata/]platform that can
   deliver the performance, scale, and agility that businesses need as
   they grow over time.

   The self-driving database is poised to provide a significant boost to
   these capabilities. Because self-driving databases automate expensive,
   time-consuming manual processes, they free up business users to become
   more proactive with their data. By having direct control over the
   ability to create and use databases, users gain control and autonomy
   while still maintaining important security standards.

Database challenges

   Today’s large enterprise databases often support very complex queries
   and are expected to deliver nearly instant responses to those queries.
   As a result, database administrators are constantly called upon to
   employ a wide variety of methods to help improve performance. Some
   common challenges that they face include:
     * Absorbing significant increases in data volume. The explosion of
       data coming in from sensors, connected machines, and dozens of
       other sources keeps database administrators scrambling to manage
       and organize their companies’ data efficiently.
     * Ensuring data security. Data breaches are happening everywhere
       these days, and hackers are getting more inventive. It’s more
       important than ever to ensure that data is secure but also easily
       accessible to users.
     * Keeping up with demand. In today’s fast-moving business
       environment, companies need real-time access to their data to
       support timely decision-making and to take advantage of new
       opportunities.
     * Managing and maintaining the database and infrastructure. Database
       administrators must continually watch the database for problems and
       perform preventative maintenance, as well as apply software
       upgrades and patches. As databases become more complex and data
       volumes grow, companies are faced with the expense of hiring
       additional talent to monitor and tune their databases.
     * Removing limits on scalability. A business needs to grow if it’s
       going to survive, and its data management must grow along with it.
       But it’s very difficult for database administrators to predict how
       much capacity the company will need, particularly with on-premises
       databases.
     * Ensuring data residency, data sovereignty, or latency requirements.
       Some organizations have use cases that are better suited to run
       on-premises. In those cases, engineered systems that are
       pre-configured and pre-optimized for running the database are
       ideal. Customers achieve higher availability, greater performance
       and up to 40% lower cost with Oracle Exadata, according to
       [https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/wikibon-cloud-database-battle.p
       df]Wikibon’s recent analysis (PDF).

   Addressing all of these challenges can be time-consuming and can
   prevent database administrators from performing more strategic
   functions.

How autonomous technology is improving database management

   Self-driving databases are the wave of the future—and offer an
   intriguing possibility for organizations that want to use the best
   available database technology without the headaches of running and
   operating that technology.

   Self-driving databases use cloud-based technology and machine learning
   to automate many of the routine tasks required to manage databases,
   such as tuning, security, backups, updates, and other routine
   management tasks. With these tedious tasks automated, database
   administrators are freed up to do more strategic work. The
   self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing capabilities of
   self-driving databases are poised to revolutionize how companies manage
   and secure their data, enabling performance advantages, lower costs,
   and improved security.

Future of databases and autonomous databases

   The first autonomous database was announced in late 2017, and multiple
   independent industry analysts quickly recognized the technology and its
   potential impact on computing.

   A
   [https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/wikibon-2021-cloud-database-platfor
   m-ratings.pdf]Wikibon 2021 report (PDF) praised autonomous database
   technology, saying, “Oracle has by far the best Tier-1 Cloud Database
   Platform…Wikibon believes Oracle has the strongest Cloud Database
   Platform with Autonomous Database.”

   And
   [https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/database-and-big-data-security.pdf]
   KuppingerCole’s 2021 Leadership Compass (PDF) said, "The Oracle
   Autonomous Database, which completely automates provisioning,
   management, tuning, and upgrade processes of database instances without
   any downtime, not just substantially increases security and compliance
   of sensitive data stored in Oracle Databases but makes a compelling
   argument for moving this data to the Oracle Cloud." Because Oracle
   Autonomous Database is built on the highly available and scalable
   architecture of
   [https://www.oracle.com/engineered-systems/exadata/]Oracle Exadata,
   it’s possible to easily scale the database deployment as needs grow.
