Test modern apps directly in the browser

   Watch your end-to-end and component tests run in real-time as you
   develop your applications. Cypress’s simple, yet powerful API runs as
   fast as your browser can render content.

   Installing Cypress and writing your first passing test is a breeze.
   There are no servers, drivers, or other dependencies to install or
   configure.

Eliminate flaky tests with ease

   Cypress deterministically interacts with your application the same way
   as your users so you can discover intermittent bugs before your users
   do.

   Every day I learn something awesome new about @Cypress_io.
   Its extensibility just makes it the super tool for new approaches and
   integrates in most environments. Especially when I compare it with
   other tools, it always feels easier and more stable to me.

   I've been meaning to express my gratitude to the incredibly talented
   people who built and maintain the docs @Cypress_io. From start to
   finish, it's such an incredible platform and so much of that is due to

   I'm awestruck with the power of @Cypress_io. It makes the development
   and automation experience so awesome that you'll fall in love with it.
   With the updates more frequent than your sprint review, cypress is
   totally disrupting the market and is here to knock your socks off.

   Cypress is a real game changer in e2e testing. It runs inside 2
   containers on our stack. The setup was almost easy and its adoption by
   the team was immediate. Now our test coverage is growing fast.
   Also mention the amazing test runner tool. @Cypress_io beats them all !

   Explaining to my 4 year old what I do for work & what automation is. So
   I showed him an automated @Cypress_io test & how its clicking and

   @Cypress_io docs must be one of the best! 🤯 Well done.
   It has it all: learning course, real world examples, best practices,
   even FAQ is impressive (it has questions I didn't even know I wanted to
   ask).
   All open source too.
