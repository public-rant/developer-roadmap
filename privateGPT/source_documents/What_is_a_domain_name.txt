s/What_is_a_domain_name#summary]Summary

   Domain names are a key part of the Internet infrastructure. They
   provide a human-readable address for any web server available on the
   Internet.

   Any Internet-connected computer can be reached through a public
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IP_Address]IP
   Address, either an IPv4 address (e.g. 173.194.121.32) or an IPv6
   address (e.g., 2027:0da8:8b73:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:1337).

   Computers can handle such addresses easily, but people have a hard time
   finding out who is running the server or what service the website
   offers. IP addresses are hard to remember and might change over time.

   To solve all those problems we use human-readable addresses called
   domain names.

s/What_is_a_domain_name#structure_of_domain_names]Structure of domain names

   A domain name has a simple structure made of several parts (it might be
   one part only, two, three…), separated by dots and read from right to
   left:

   Anatomy of the MDN domain name

   Each of those parts provides specific information about the whole
   domain name.

   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLD]TLD (Top-Level
          Domain).
          TLDs tell users the general purpose of the service behind the
          domain name. The most generic TLDs (.com, .org, .net) don't
          require web services to meet any particular criteria, but some
          TLDs enforce stricter policies so it is clearer what their
          purpose is. For example:

          + Local TLDs such as .us, .fr, or .se can require the service to
            be provided in a given language or hosted in a certain country
            — they are supposed to indicate a resource in a particular
            language or country.
          + TLDs containing .gov are only allowed to be used by government
            departments.
          + The .edu TLD is only for use by educational and academic
            institutions.

          TLDs can contain special as well as latin characters. A TLD's
          maximum length is 63 characters, although most are around 2–3.

          The full list of TLDs is
          [https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/tlds-2012-02-25-en]mainta
          ined by ICANN.

   Label (or component)
          The labels are what follow the TLD. A label is a
          case-insensitive character sequence anywhere from one to
          sixty-three characters in length, containing only the letters A
          through Z, digits 0 through 9, and the '-' character (which may
          not be the first or last character in the label). a, 97, and
          hello-strange-person-16-how-are-you are all examples of valid
          labels.

          The label located right before the TLD is also called a
          Secondary Level Domain (SLD).

          A domain name can have many labels (or components). It is not
          mandatory nor necessary to have 3 labels to form a domain name.
          For instance, [http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/]www.inf.ed.ac.uk is a
          valid domain name. For any domain you control (e.g.
          [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/]mozilla.org), you can create
          "subdomains" with different content located at each, like
          [https://developer.mozilla.org/]developer.mozilla.org,
          [https://iot.mozilla.org/]iot.mozilla.org, or
          [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/]bugzilla.mozilla.org.

s/What_is_a_domain_name#buying_a_domain_name]Buying a domain name

Who owns a domain name?

   You cannot "buy a domain name". This is so that unused domain names
   eventually become available to be used again by someone else. If every
   domain name was bought, the web would quickly fill up with unused
   domain names that were locked and couldn't be used by anyone.

   Instead, you pay for the right to use a domain name for one or more
   years. You can renew your right, and your renewal has priority over
   other people's applications. But you never own the domain name.

   Companies called registrars use domain name registries to keep track of
   technical and administrative information connecting you to your domain
   name.

   Note: For some domain name, it might not be a registrar which is in
   charge of keeping track. For instance, every domain name under .fire is
   managed by Amazon.

Finding an available domain name

   To find out whether a given domain name is available,
     * Go to a domain name registrar's website. Most of them provide a
       "whois" service that tells you whether a domain name is available.
     * Alternatively, if you use a system with a built-in shell, type a
       whois command into it, as shown here for mozilla.org:
       bash
$ whois mozilla.org
Domain Name:MOZILLA.ORG
Domain ID: D1409563-LROR
Creation Date: 1998-01-24T05:00:00Z
Updated Date: 2013-12-08T01:16:57Z

Registrant Country:US
Registrant Phone:+1.6509030800

   As you can see, I can't register mozilla.org because the Mozilla
   Foundation has already registered it.

   On the other hand, let's see if I could register afunkydomainname.org:

   bash
$ whois afunkydomainname.org
NOT FOUND

   As you can see, the domain does not exist in the whois database (at the
   time of writing), so we could ask to register it. Good to know!

Getting a domain name

   The process is quite straightforward:
    1. Go to a registrar's website.
    2. Usually there is a prominent "Get a domain name" call to action.
       Click on it.
    3. Fill out the form with all required details. Make sure, especially,
       that you have not misspelled your desired domain name. Once it's
       paid for, it's too late!
    4. The registrar will let you know when the domain name is properly
       registered. Within a few hours, all DNS servers will have received
       your DNS information.

   Note: In this process the registrar asks you for your real-world
   address. Make sure you fill it properly, since in some countries
   registrars may be forced to close the domain if they cannot provide a
   valid address.

DNS refreshing

   DNS databases are stored on every DNS server worldwide, and all these
   servers refer to a few special servers called "authoritative name
   servers" or "top-level DNS servers" — these are like the boss servers
   that manage the system.

   Whenever your registrar creates or updates any information for a given
   domain, the information must be refreshed in every DNS database. Each
   DNS server that knows about a given domain stores the information for
   some time before it is automatically invalidated and then refreshed
   (the DNS server queries an authoritative server and fetches the updated
   information from it). Thus, it takes some time for DNS servers that
   know about this domain name to get the up-to-date information.

s/What_is_a_domain_name#how_does_a_dns_request_work]How does a DNS request
work?

   As we already saw, when you want to display a webpage in your browser
   it's easier to type a domain name than an IP address. Let's take a look
   at the process:
    1. Type mozilla.org in your browser's location bar.
    2. Your browser asks your computer if it already recognizes the IP
       address identified by this domain name (using a local DNS cache).
       If it does, the name is translated to the IP address and the
       browser negotiates contents with the web server. End of story.
    3. If your computer does not know which IP is behind the mozilla.org
       name, it goes on to ask a DNS server, whose job is precisely to
       tell your computer which IP address matches each registered domain
       name.
    4. Now that the computer knows the requested IP address, your browser
       can negotiate contents with the web server.
