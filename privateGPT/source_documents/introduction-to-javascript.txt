     * I've taken courses through a coding school where I live as well as
       on Udacity and Pluralsight, but this Codecademy course made
       objects, methods, getters and setters, and so many key concepts so
       much more plain and simple for me. With the other courses, I
       assumed it was something I'd get "one day" and just plodded along
       to keep learning.

     * I've gone through beginner-level JavaScript courses before, but
       none compare to Codecademy! The structure of this course was
       practically flawless. Each lesson built my understanding precept
       upon precept. It was laid out logically, with good reason.
       David P.
       Verified Learner
     * Very helpful for beginners. Breaks things down into bite-sized
       pieces that are easily digestible. Provides a good foundation for
       understanding the basics of programming. The exercises are also
       very helpful in helping to solidify the concepts that are being
       taught.
