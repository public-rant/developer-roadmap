   OVERVIEW

   Frontend development requires much more than writing code. Like other
   aspects of technology, the goals of frontend development have changed
   over the last decade. Under this topic, we discuss frontend development
   and its benefits, challenges faced by developers, and new trends The
   New Stack watches out for in software development.

   Frontend development requires much more than writing code. Like other
   aspects of technology, the goals of frontend development have changed
   over the last decade. Under this topic, we discuss frontend development
   and its benefits, challenges faced by developers, and new trends The
   New Stack watches out for in software development.

   What Is Frontend Development?

   Frontend development, also known as client-side development, is the
   implementation of the vision and design concept of web pages or
   applications through code.

   A fascinating aspect of frontend development is the emergence of new
   architectures in the early 2020s. We track closely two of them:
     * Web3 (blockchain combined with web architecture)
     * Metaverse (a yet-to-be built 3D version of the internet, supported
       by Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and others)

   There are increasing opportunities for frontend developers to make an
   impact in both Web3 and the metaverse.

   What Does a Frontend Developer Do?

   All developers must know how to wrangle data. We cover everything from
   APIs and databases to the new paradigm of decentralized storage in
   Web3. Machine learning is also increasingly important to developers, in
   particular with the programming language Python.

   A frontend developer is in charge of executing design and content
   directions through code. These developers enable interfaces to look
   pleasing on all devices — phones, tablets, and computers. Frontend
   developers aim to provide the best user experience for customers and
   ensure that the overall software layout is consistent.

   Programming Languages for Frontend Developers

   To develop client-facing sections of the software, a developer needs to
   be familiar with these three main languages:
     * HTML
     * CSS
     * JavaScript

   Knowledge of libraries, frameworks, and other relevant tools can come
   after mastery of the core programming languages.

   The Rise of Low-Code Solutions

   Low-code is quickly becoming a viable method of creating applications
   for enterprises and governments. We track the impact of low-code and
   visual programming in general on the wider frontend development
   industry.

   The frontend development world is dominated by JavaScript, including
   popular frameworks such as React, Vue, and Angular. We cover all the
   latest developments in JS frameworks, including ways to potentially
   route around them — for example, with Web Components, an HTML-native
   alternative to using JavaScript.

   Frontend vs. Backend vs. Full Stack Development

   Software development is the process of creating, deploying, and
   delivering computer code. There are different aspects of software
   development, each with its own approach.

   Frontend development, as stated earlier, is the codification of design
   concepts to create a satisfactory user experience.

   Backend development, also known as server-side development, deals with
   the more technical aspects of creating software. Backend development
   revolves around databases, APIs, backend logic, and servers.

   A backend developer aids communication between browsers and databases
   and writes code to store, update, retrieve, and delete data depending
   on the user’s desired action.

   Full stack development is the combination of both client-facing and
   server-side development activities. Full stack developers work on both
   frontend and backend to design complete web applications.

   Why Frontend Development Is Important

   As more businesses compete for customers’ attention, the ability to
   stand out among similar organizations is essential to a company’s
   success. Frontend development activities result in the first
   touchpoints for many clients or customers and can be the determining
   factor in organizational performance.

   Here are some of the reasons why frontend development is vital:

   Successful Branding

   The execution of a good frontend development plan results in powerful
   branding. When all logos, colors, and elements reflect an
   organization’s beliefs and values, customers are able to associate the
   software with the brand easily. This prevents a disconnection in sales
   processes and increases conversions.

   Brand Confidence

   A web application with a clean layout and clear focus portrays a brand
   as competent and capable of delivering quality products and services.
   Proper design implementation through software development also builds
   customers’ confidence in an organization.

   Optimized Navigation

   Frontend development makes navigation around a website or application
   easy. Users are able to find what they are looking for easily, leading
   to a better experience and visitor retention.

   Frontend Development Challenges

   Frontend development is advancing at a pace that is difficult to keep
   up with. However, there are certain recurring challenges that surface
   in spite of the new direction of frontend development.

   Some challenges faced by software engineers and other specialists in
   the frontend development space are:

   Balancing long-term and short-term design decisions. As design
   preferences change throughout the years within organizations,
   maintaining a balance between core design principles and new trends may
   be slightly challenging.

   Understanding and communicating search engine optimization (SEO)
   concepts. Asides from providing a great user experience, getting web
   pages seen is a priority for organizations. Ensuring that frontend
   development activities follow best SEO practices can be challenging.
   especially when other teams are not aware of its importance.

   Coding JavaScript in a robust way. In the past, JavaScript wasn’t a
   dominant programming language, and many solutions were not JavaScript
   intensive. Now, many web applications require that JavaScript is
   working and be maintained on all browsers.

   Selecting the right tools. Given the many libraries, frameworks, and
   programming languages existing today, it can be a challenge to choose
   the right tools for your project. Each tool has its perks and
   drawbacks.

   Ensuring that all user interface (UI) elements work as intended. As
   frontend developers implement design directions, ensuring that all
   flips, movements, and other elements appear as intended may be
   difficult to achieve.

   Explore Software Development News on The New Stack

   At The New Stack, we keep tabs on emerging frontend development
   languages and tools such as Svelte. We also monitor the incorporation
   of web animation, motion designs, APIs, and CSS animations in frontend
   development. As part of our coverage, we explore the technical
   foundations of emerging platforms such as Web3.

   Tracking technical progress on the web platform is also a key part of
   our coverage — browser technology, web standards, and cross-platform
   mobile technologies such as Flutter and React Native. We occasionally
   look into mobile internet development, too, but we have a keen interest
   in reporting on open web technologies.
