What is a time series database?

   imeo.com/video/660763763?h=4a1a95fd64

   A time series database (TSDB) is a database optimized for
   [https://www.influxdata.com/what-is-time-series-data/]time-stamped or
   time series data. Time series data are simply measurements or events
   that are tracked, monitored, downsampled, and aggregated over time.
   This could be server metrics, application performance monitoring,
   network data, sensor data, events, clicks, trades in a market, and many
   other types of analytics data.

   A
   [https://www.influxdata.com/the-best-way-to-store-collect-analyze-time-
   series-data/]time series database is built specifically for handling
   metrics and events or measurements that are time-stamped. A
   [https://www.influxdata.com/from-sql-to-nosql/]TSDB is optimized for
   measuring change over time. Properties that make time series data very
   different than other data workloads are data lifecycle management,
   summarization, and large range scans of many records.

Why is a time series database important now?

   Time series databases are not new, but the first-generation time series
   databases were primarily focused on looking at financial data, the
   volatility of stock trading, and systems built to solve trading. But
   financial data is hardly the only
   [https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-technical-paper/]application of
   time series data anymore — in fact, it’s only one among numerous
   applications across various industries. The fundamental conditions of
   computing have changed dramatically over the last decade. Everything
   has become compartmentalized. Monolithic mainframes have vanished,
   replaced by serverless servers, microservers, and containers.

   Today, everything that can be a component is a component. In addition,
   we are witnessing the instrumentation of every available surface in the
   material world — streets, cars, factories, power grids, ice caps,
   satellites, clothing, phones, microwaves, milk containers, planets,
   human bodies. Everything has, or will have, a sensor. So now,
   everything inside and outside the company is emitting a relentless
   stream of metrics and events or time series data.

   Want to know more?
   [https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-database/#download]Download the
   Paper

   This means that the underlying platforms need to evolve to support
   these new workloads — more data points, more data sources, more
   monitoring, more controls. What we’re witnessing, and what the times
   demand, is a paradigmatic shift in how we approach our data
   infrastructure and how we approach building, monitoring, controlling,
   and managing systems. What we need is a performant, scalable,
   purpose-built time series database.

What distinguishes the time series workload?

   Time series databases have key architectural design properties that
   make them very different from other databases. These include time-stamp
   data storage and compression, data lifecycle management, data
   summarization, ability to handle large time series dependent scans of
   many records, and time series aware queries.

   downsample

   For example: With a time series database, it is common to request a
   summary of data over a large time period. This requires going over a
   range of data points to perform some computation like a percentile
   increase this month of a metric over the same period in the last six
   months, summarized by month. This kind of workload is very difficult to
   optimize for with a distributed key value store. TSDB’s are optimized
   for exactly this use case giving millisecond level query times over
   months of data. Another example: With time series databases, it’s
   common to keep high precision data around for a short period of time.
   This data is aggregated and downsampled into longer term trend data.
   This means that for every data point that goes into the database, it
   will have to be deleted after its period of time is up. This kind of
   data lifecycle management is difficult for application developers to
   implement on top of regular databases. They must devise schemes for
   cheaply evicting large sets of data and constantly summarizing that
   data at scale. With a time series database, this functionality is
   provided out of the box.

Independent ranking of top 15 time series databases

   Time series databases are the fastest growing segment in the database
   industry. But which time series database is the best and most popular?
   There are many ways of determining popularity, but an independent
   website,

   databases based on search engine popularity, social media mentions, job
   postings, and technical discussion volume.

What makes InfluxDB time series database unique?

   [https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/]InfluxDB was
   built from the ground up to be a purpose-built time series database;
   i.e., it was not repurposed to be time series. Time was built-in from
   the beginning. InfluxDB is part of a
   [https://www.influxdata.com/products/]comprehensive platform that
   supports the collection, storage, monitoring, visualization and
   alerting of time series data. It’s much more than just a time series
   database.

   The whole InfluxData platform is built from an
   [https://www.influxdata.com/]open source db core. InfluxData is an
   active contributor to the
   [https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/]Telegraf, [h

   and [https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/kapacitor/]Kapacit
   or (TICK) projects — the “I,C,K” from the TICK Stack is being collapsed
   into a single binary in

   [https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-enterprise]InfluxDB
   Enterprise and [https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-cloud/]Inf
   luxDB Cloud on this open source core. The InfluxDB data model is quite
   different from other time series solutions like Graphite, RRD, or
   OpenTSDB. InfluxDB has a line protocol for sending time series data
   which takes the following form: measurement-name tag-set field-set
   timestamp. The measurement name is a string, the tag set is a
   collection of key/value pairs where all values are strings, and the
   field set is a collection of key/value pairs where the values can be
   int64, float64, bool, or string. The measurement name and tag sets are
   kept in an inverted index which make lookups for specific series very
   fast. For example, if we have
   [https://www.influxdata.com/integration/cpu/]CPU metrics:
cpu,host=serverA,region=uswest idle=23,user=42,system=12 1464623548s

   Timestamps in InfluxDB can be second, millisecond, microsecond, or
   nanosecond precision. The micro and nanosecond scales make InfluxDB a
   good choice for use cases in finance and scientific computing where
   other solutions would be excluded. Compression is variable depending on
   the level of precision the user needs. On disk, the data is organized
   in a columnar style format where contiguous blocks of time are set for
   the measurement, tagset, field. So, each field is organized
   sequentially on disk for blocks of time, which make calculating
   aggregates on a single field a very fast operation. There is no limit
   to the number of tags and fields that can be used.

   Other time series solutions don’t support multiple fields, which can
   make their network protocols bloated when transmitting data with shared
   tag sets. Most other time series solutions only support float64 values,
   which means the user is unable to encode additional metadata along with
   the time series. Even OpenTSDB and KairosDB, which support tags (unlike
   Graphite and RRD), have limitations on the number of tags that can be
   used. At around 5 to 6 tags, the user will start seeing hot spots
   within their cluster of HBase or Cassandra machines.

   InfluxDB doesn’t have this limitation because the InfluxDB data model
   is designed for time series specifically. It pushes the developer in
   the right direction to get good performance out of the database by
   indexing tags and keeping fields unindexed. It’s flexible in that many
   data types are supported, and the user can have many fields and tags.
   Because of all these factors, a purpose-built time series database like
   InfluxDB is the best solution for working with time series data.

Time series databases: FAQ

   Listed below for quick reference are brief answers to frequently asked
   questions about time series databases:

What is a time series database?

   Here’s a brief time series database definition: A time series database
