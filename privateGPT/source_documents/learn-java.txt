     * The Intro to Java course was able to break down multiple concepts
       into easily digestible chunks. I actually felt like I was
       practicing the information the moment I was learning it, as opposed
       to just watching a video and trying to remember what was said
       afterwards.

       Verified Learner
     * Very organized course overall, well-structured sub-tasks and great
       quality tips and notes in every lesson. For someone with a
       Codecademy subscription, and no background in Java, this course
       does the job of setting up the foundations and developing a
       critical-thinking repertoire to tackle problems in Java.
