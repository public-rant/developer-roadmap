   to read, and it is also a good language to have in any programmer’s
   stack as it can be used for everything from web development to software
   development and scientific applications.

     * The progress I have made since starting to use codecademy is
       immense! I can study for short periods or long periods at my own
       convenience - mostly late in the evenings.

       Codecademy Learner @ USA
     * I felt like I learned months in a week. I love how Codecademy uses
       learning by practice and gives great challenges to help the learner
       to understand a new concept and subject.

       changer if you're learning on your own.
