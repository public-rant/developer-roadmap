Avoid installing dependencies

   Dive right into the code and skip the setup.
   Web APIs

Web-standard APIs

   A runtime that resembles the web, using browser APIs that work on the
   server.

TypeScript out of the box

   First-class support for TypeScript – no need to spend hours configuring
   things that break as soon as you update a dependency.

Great all-in-one tooling

   Built in linter, code formatter, ability to build a self-contained
   executable, test runner, IDE integration, and more.

Hassle-free deployment

   Launch to Deno Deploy with one line of code and zero server
   configuration, or host with other platforms of your choice.

     "Voted one of the most loved web technologies
     in a survey of over 70,000 developers"

   p_flash.js]HTTP hello⁠-⁠world using wrk on mac⁠)

Powered by Chrome's V8

   Built on top of the fastest and most complete JavaScript engine.

     "What stood out first and foremost to our team was their laser focus
     on security... like the ability to execute code with limited access
     to the file system or external domains."

   Secure

Secure by default.

permission checks

   Provide an allow-list to access only certain file system directories,
   network hosts, and environment variables.
