   "The best part of programming is the triumph of seeing the machine do
   something useful. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python frames all of
   programming as these small triumphs; it makes the boring fun."
   - [https://twitter.com/hmason]Hilary Mason, Data Scientist and Founder
   of [http://www.fastforwardlabs.com/]Fast Forward Labs

   "I'm having a lot of fun breaking things and then putting them back
   together, and just remembering the joy of turning a set of instructions
   into something useful and fun, like I did when I was a kid."

Practical Programming for Total Beginners

   If you've ever spent hours renaming files or updating hundreds of
   spreadsheet cells, you know how tedious tasks like these can be. But
   what if you could have your computer do them for you?

   In [https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc]Automate the Boring Stuff
   with Python, you'll learn how to use Python to write programs that do
   in minutes what would take you hours to do by hand - no prior
   programming experience required. Once you've mastered the basics of
   programming, you'll create Python programs that effortlessly perform
   useful and impressive feats of automation to:
     * Search for text in a file or across multiple files
     * Create, update, move, and rename files and folders
     * Search the Web and download online content
     * Update and format data in Excel spreadsheets of any size
     * Split, merge, watermark, and encrypt PDFs
     * Send reminder emails and text notifications
     * Fill out online forms

   Step-by-step instructions walk you through each program, and practice
   projects at the end of each chapter challenge you to improve those
   programs and use your newfound skills to automate similar tasks.

   Don't spend your time doing work a well-trained monkey could do. Even
   if you've never written a line of code, you can make your computer do
   the grunt work. Learn how in Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.
