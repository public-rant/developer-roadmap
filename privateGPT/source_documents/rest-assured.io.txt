   Testing and validating REST services in Java is harder than in dynamic
   languages such as Ruby and Groovy. REST Assured brings the simplicity
   of using these languages into the Java domain. For example, if your
   HTTP server returns the following [http://www.json.org/]JSON at
   “http://localhost:8080/lotto/{id}”:
{
   "lotto":{
      "lottoId":5,
      "winning-numbers":[2,45,34,23,7,5,3],
      "winners":[
         {
            "winnerId":23,
            "numbers":[2,45,34,23,3,5]
         },
         {
            "winnerId":54,
            "numbers":[52,3,12,11,18,22]
         }
      ]
   }
}

   You can easily use REST Assured to validate interesting things from the
   response:
@Test public void
lotto_resource_returns_200_with_expected_id_and_winners() {

    when().
            get("/lotto/{id}", 5).
    then().
            statusCode(200).
            body("lotto.lottoId", equalTo(5),
                 "lotto.winners.winnerId", hasItems(23, 54));

}

   Looks easy enough? Why not give it a spin? See
