   The term Memory can be defined as a collection of data in a specific
   format. It is used to store instructions and process data. The memory
   comprises a large array or group of words or bytes, each with its own
   location. The primary motive of a computer system is to execute
   programs. These programs, along with the information they access,
   should be in the main memory during execution. The CPU fetches
   instructions from memory according to the value of the program
   counter.

   To achieve a degree of multiprogramming and proper utilization of
   memory, memory management is important. Many memory management methods
   exist, reflecting various approaches, and the effectiveness of each
   algorithm depends on the situation.

     Here, we will cover the following memory management topics:

     * What is Main Memory?
     * What is Memory Management?
     * Why memory Management is required?
     * Logical address space and Physical address space

               o Internal Fragmentation
               o External Fragmentation
          + Paging

   Now before, we start Memory Management let us know what is main memory.

What is Main Memory?

   The main memory is central to the operation of a Modern Computer. Main
   Memory is a large array of words or bytes, ranging in size from
   hundreds of thousands to billions. Main memory is a repository of
   rapidly available information shared by the CPU and I/O devices. Main
   memory is the place where programs and information are kept when the
   processor is effectively utilizing them.  Main memory is associated
   with the processor, so moving instructions and information into and out
   of the processor is extremely fast.  Main memory is also known as
   [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-access-memory-ram/]RAM (Random
   Access Memory). This memory is a volatile memory. RAM lost its data
   when a power interruption occurs.

What is Memory Management?

   In a multiprogramming computer, the Operating System resides in a part
   of memory and the rest is used by multiple processes. The task of
   subdividing the memory among different processes is called Memory
   Management. Memory management is a method in the operating system to
   manage operations between main memory and disk during process
   execution. The main aim of memory management is to achieve efficient
   utilization of memory.

Why Memory Management is Required?

     * Allocate and de-allocate memory before and after process execution.
     * To keep track of used memory space by processes.
     * To minimize fragmentation issues.
     * To proper utilization of main memory.
     * To maintain data integrity while executing of process.

   Now we are discussing the concept of Logical Address Space and Physical
   Address Space

Logical and Physical Address Space

     * Logical Address Space: An address generated by the CPU is known as
       a “Logical Address”. It is also known as a Virtual address. Logical
       address space can be defined as the size of the process. A logical
       address can be changed.
     * Physical Address Space: An address seen by the memory unit (i.e the
       one loaded into the memory address register of the memory) is
       commonly known as a “Physical Address”. A Physical address is also
       known as a Real address. The set of all physical addresses
       corresponding to these logical addresses is known as Physical
       address space. A physical address is computed by MMU. The run-time
       mapping from virtual to physical addresses is done by a hardware
       device Memory Management Unit(MMU). The physical address always
       remains constant.

Static and Dynamic Loading

   Loading a process into the main memory is done by a loader. There are
   two different types of loading :
     * Static Loading: Static Loading is basically loading the entire
       program into a fixed address. It requires more memory space.
     * Dynamic Loading: The entire program and all data of a process must
       be in physical memory for the process to execute. So, the size of a
       process is limited to the size of physical memory. To gain proper
       memory utilization, dynamic loading is used. In dynamic loading, a
       routine is not loaded until it is called. All routines are residing
       on disk in a relocatable load format. One of the advantages of
       dynamic loading is that the unused routine is never loaded. This
       loading is useful when a large amount of code is needed to handle
       it efficiently.

Static and Dynamic Linking

   To perform a linking task a linker is used. A linker is a program that
   takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines
   them into a single executable file.
     * Static Linking: In
       [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-and-dynamic-linking-in-operat
       ing-systems/]static linking, the linker combines all necessary
       program modules into a single executable program. So there is no
       runtime dependency. Some operating systems support only static
       linking, in which system language libraries are treated like any
       other object module.
     * Dynamic Linking: The basic concept of dynamic linking is similar to
       dynamic loading. In dynamic linking, “Stub” is included for each
       appropriate library routine reference. A stub is a small piece of
       code. When the stub is executed, it checks whether the needed
       routine is already in memory or not. If not available then the
       program loads the routine into memory.

Swapping

   When a process is executed it must have resided in memory.
   [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swapping-in-operating-system/]Swapping
   is a process of swapping a process temporarily into a secondary memory
   from the main memory, which is fast compared to secondary memory. A
   swapping allows more processes to be run and can be fit into memory at
   one time. The main part of swapping is transferred time and the total
   time is directly proportional to the amount of memory swapped. Swapping
   is also known as roll-out, or roll because if a higher priority process
   arrives and wants service, the memory manager can swap out the lower
   priority process and then load and execute the higher priority process.
   After finishing higher priority work, the lower priority process
   swapped back in memory and continued to the execution process.

Memory Management with Monoprogramming (Without Swapping)

   This is the simplest memory management approach the memory is divided
   into two sections:
     * One part of the operating system
     * The second part of the user program

                   Fence Register
    operating system  user program
     * In this approach, the operating system keeps track of the first and
       last location available for the allocation of the user program
     * The operating system is loaded either at the bottom or at top
     * Interrupt vectors are often loaded in low memory therefore it makes
       sense to load the operating system in low memory
     * Sharing of data and code does not make much sense in a single
       process environment
     * The Operating system can be protected from user programs with the
       help of a fence register.

Advantages of Memory Management

     * It is a simple management approach

Disadvantages of Memory Management

     * It does not support multiprogramming
     * Memory is wasted

Multiprogramming with Fixed Partitions (Without Swapping)

     * Memory partitions scheme with a fixed number of partitions was
       introduced to support multiprogramming. this scheme is based on
       contiguous allocation
     * Each partition is a block of contiguous memory
     * Memory is partitioned into a fixed number of partition
     * Each partition is of fixed size

   Example: As shown in fig. memory is partitioned into 5 regions the
   region is reserved for updating the system the remaining four
   partitions are for the user program
   operating system
   p1
   p2
   p3
   p4



            Fixed Size Partitioning

Partition Table

   Once partitions are defined operating system keeps track of the status
   of  memory partitions it is done through a data structure called a
   partition table
   Starting Address of Partition Size of Partition  Status
   0k                            200k              allocated
   200k                          100k              free
   300k                          150k              free
   450k                          250k              allocated



            Sample Partition Table

Logical vs Physical Address

   An address generated by the CPU is commonly referred to as a logical
   address. the address seen by the memory unit is known as the physical
   address. The logical address can be mapped to a physical address by
   hardware with the help of a base register this is known as dynamic
   relocation of memory reference.

Contiguous  Memory Allocation

   The main memory should oblige both the operating system and the
   different client processes.  Therefore, the allocation of memory
   becomes an important task in the operating system.  The memory is
   usually divided into two partitions: one for the resident operating
   system and one for the user processes. We normally need several user
   processes to reside in memory simultaneously. Therefore, we need to
   consider how to allocate available memory to the processes that are in
   the input queue waiting to be brought into memory. In adjacent memory
   allotment, each process is contained in a single contiguous segment of
   memory.
   Contiguous Memory Allocation

   Contiguous Memory Allocation

Memory Allocation

   To gain proper memory utilization, memory allocation must be allocated
   efficient manner. One of the simplest methods for allocating memory is
   to divide memory into several fixed-sized partitions and each partition
   contains exactly one process. Thus, the degree of multiprogramming is
   obtained by the number of partitions.
     * Multiple partition allocation: In this method, a process is
       selected from the input queue and loaded into the free partition.
       When the process terminates, the partition becomes available for
       other processes.
     * Fixed partition allocation: In this method, the operating system
       maintains a table that indicates which parts of memory are
       available and which are occupied by processes. Initially, all
       memory is available for user processes and is considered one large
       block of available memory. This available memory is known as a
       “Hole”. When the process arrives and needs memory, we search for a
       hole that is large enough to store this process. If the requirement
       is fulfilled then we allocate memory to process, otherwise keeping
       the rest available to satisfy future requests. While allocating a
       memory sometimes dynamic storage allocation problems occur, which
       concerns how to satisfy a request of size n from a list of free
       holes. There are some solutions to this problem:

First Fit

   In the
   [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/first-fit-allocation-in-operating-system
   s/]First Fit, the first available free hole fulfil the requirement of
   the process allocated.
   First Fit

   First Fit

   Here, in this diagram, a 40 KB memory block is the first available free
   hole that can store process A (size of 25 KB), because the first two
   blocks did not have sufficient memory space.

Best Fit

   In the
   [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/best-fit-allocation-in-operating-system/
   ]Best Fit, allocate the smallest hole that is big enough to process
   requirements. For this, we search the entire list, unless the list is
   ordered by size.
   Best Fit

   Best Fit

   Here in this example, first, we traverse the complete list and find the
   last hole 25KB is the best suitable hole for Process A(size 25KB). In
   this method, memory utilization is maximum as compared to other memory
   allocation techniques.

Worst Fit

   In the
   [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/worst-fit-allocation-in-operating-system
   s/]Worst Fit, allocate the largest available hole to process. This
   method produces the largest leftover hole.
   Worst Fit

   Worst Fit

   Here in this example, Process A (Size 25 KB) is allocated to the
   largest available memory block which is 60KB. Inefficient memory
   utilization is a major issue in the worst fit.

Fragmentation

   [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fragmentation-network-layer/]Fragmentati
   on is defined as when the process is loaded and removed after execution
   from memory, it creates a small free hole. These holes can not be
   assigned to new processes because holes are not combined or do not
   fulfill the memory requirement of the process.  To achieve a degree of
   multiprogramming, we must reduce the waste of memory or fragmentation
   problems. In the operating systems two types of fragmentation:
    1. Internal fragmentation:
       [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-internal-and-exte
       rnal-fragmentation/]Internal fragmentation occurs when memory
       blocks are allocated to the process more than their requested size.
       Due to this some unused space is left over and creating an internal
       fragmentation problem.Example: Suppose there is a fixed
       partitioning used for memory allocation and the different sizes of
       blocks 3MB, 6MB, and 7MB space in memory. Now a new process p4 of
       size 2MB comes and demands a block of memory. It gets a memory
       block of 3MB but 1MB block of memory is a waste, and it can not be
       allocated to other processes too. This is called internal
       fragmentation.
    2. External fragmentation: In
       [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-internal-and-exte
       rnal-fragmentation/]External Fragmentation, we have a free memory
       block, but we can not assign it to a process because blocks are not
       contiguous. Example: Suppose (consider the above example) three
       processes p1, p2, and p3 come with sizes 2MB, 4MB, and 7MB
       respectively. Now they get memory blocks of size 3MB, 6MB, and 7MB
       allocated respectively. After allocating the process p1 process and
       the p2 process left 1MB and 2MB. Suppose a new process p4 comes and
       demands a 3MB block of memory, which is available, but we can not
       assign it because free memory space is not contiguous.  This is
       called external fragmentation.

   Both the first-fit and best-fit systems for memory allocation are
   affected by external fragmentation. To overcome the external
   fragmentation problem Compaction is used. In the compaction technique,
   all free memory space combines and makes one large block. So, this
   space can be used by other processes effectively.

   Another possible solution to the external fragmentation is to allow the
   logical address space of the processes to be noncontiguous, thus
   permitting a process to be allocated physical memory wherever the
   latter is available.

Paging

   [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/]Paging is a
   memory management scheme that eliminates the need for a contiguous
   allocation of physical memory. This scheme permits the physical address
   space of a process to be non-contiguous.
     * Logical Address or Virtual Address (represented in bits): An
       address generated by the CPU
     * Logical Address Space or Virtual Address Space (represented in
       words or bytes): The set of all logical addresses generated by a
       program
     * Physical Address (represented in bits): An address actually
       available on a memory unit
     * Physical Address Space (represented in words or bytes): The set of
       all physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses

   Example:
     * If Logical Address = 31 bits, then Logical Address Space = 2^31
       words = 2 G words (1 G = 2^30)
     * If Logical Address Space = 128 M words = 2^7 * 2^20 words, then
       Logical Address = log[2] 2^27 = 27 bits
     * If Physical Address = 22 bits, then Physical Address Space = 2^22
       words = 4 M words (1 M = 2^20)
     * If Physical Address Space = 16 M words = 2^4 * 2^20 words, then
       Physical Address = log[2] 2^24 = 24 bits

   The mapping from virtual to physical address is done by the memory
   management unit (MMU) which is a hardware device and this mapping is
   known as the paging technique.
     * The Physical Address Space is conceptually divided into several
       fixed-size blocks, called frames.
     * The Logical Address Space is also split into fixed-size blocks,
       called pages.
     * Page Size = Frame Size

   Let us consider an example:
     * Physical Address = 12 bits, then Physical Address Space = 4 K words
     * Logical Address = 13 bits, then Logical Address Space = 8 K words
     * Page size = frame size = 1 K words (assumption)

   Paging

   Paging

   The address generated by the CPU is divided into:
     * Page Number(p): Number of bits required to represent the pages in
       Logical Address Space or Page number
     * Page Offset(d): Number of bits required to represent a particular
       word in a page or page size of Logical Address Space or word number
       of a page or page offset.

   Physical Address is divided into:
     * Frame Number(f): Number of bits required to represent the frame of
       Physical Address Space or Frame number frame
     * Frame Offset(d): Number of bits required to represent a particular
       word in a frame or frame size of Physical Address Space or word
       number of a frame or frame offset.

   The hardware implementation of the page table can be done by using
   dedicated registers. But the usage of the register for the page table
   is satisfactory only if the page table is small. If the page table
   contains a large number of entries then we can use TLB(translation
   Look-aside buffer), a special, small, fast look-up hardware cache.
     * The TLB is an associative, high-speed memory.
     * Each entry in TLB consists of two parts: a tag and a value.
     * When this memory is used, then an item is compared with all tags
       simultaneously. If the item is found, then the corresponding value
       is returned.
