About this course

   Go (or Golang) is an open source programming language designed to build
   fast, reliable, and efficient software at scale.

   Google uses Go specifically for its large networks of servers, and Go
   also powers much of Google’s own cloud platform. Developers use Go in
   application development, web development, in operations and
   infrastructure teams, and much more. It is the language of Cloud Native
   infrastructure and software development.

   As Go’s popularity and adoption continue to increase, we’ll see even
   greater usage and more creative implementations of the language!
