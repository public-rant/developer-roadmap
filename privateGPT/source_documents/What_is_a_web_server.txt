s/What_is_a_web_server#summary]Summary

   The term web server can refer to hardware or software, or both of them
   working together.
    1. On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web
       server software and a website's component files (for example, HTML
       documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files). A web
       server connects to the Internet and supports physical data
       interchange with other devices connected to the web.
    2. On the software side, a web server includes several parts that
       control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, this is an
       HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL]URLs (web
       addresses) and
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP]HTTP (the
       protocol your browser uses to view webpages). An HTTP server can be
       accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it
       delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's
       device.

   At the most basic level, whenever a browser needs a file that is hosted
   on a web server, the browser requests the file via HTTP. When the
   request reaches the correct (hardware) web server, the (software) HTTP
   server accepts the request, finds the requested document, and sends it
   back to the browser, also through HTTP. (If the server doesn't find the
   requested document, it returns a
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404]404
   response instead.)

   Basic representation of a client/server connection through HTTP

   To publish a website, you need either a static or a dynamic web server.

   A static web server, or stack, consists of a computer (hardware) with
   an HTTP server (software). We call it "static" because the server sends
   its hosted files as-is to your browser.

   A dynamic web server consists of a static web server plus extra
   software, most commonly an application server and a database. We call
   it "dynamic" because the application server updates the hosted files
   before sending content to your browser via the HTTP server.

   For example, to produce the final webpages you see in the browser, the
   application server might fill an HTML template with content from a
   database. Sites like MDN or Wikipedia have thousands of webpages.
   Typically, these kinds of sites are composed of only a few HTML
   templates and a giant database, rather than thousands of static HTML
   documents. This setup makes it easier to maintain and deliver the
   content.

s/What_is_a_web_server#deeper_dive]Deeper dive

   To review: to fetch a webpage, your browser sends a request to the web
   server, which searches for the requested file in its own storage space.
   Upon finding the file, the server reads it, processes it as needed, and
   sends it to the browser. Let's look at those steps in more detail.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanic
s/What_is_a_web_server#hosting_files]Hosting files

   First, a web server has to store the website's files, namely all HTML
   documents and their related assets, including images, CSS stylesheets,
   JavaScript files, fonts, and video.

   Technically, you could host all those files on your own computer, but
   it's far more convenient to store files all on a dedicated web server
   because:
     * A dedicated web server is typically more available (up and
       running).
     * Excluding downtime and system troubles, a dedicated web server is
       always connected to the Internet.
     * A dedicated web server can have the same IP address all the time.
       This is known as a dedicated IP address. (Not all
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ISP]ISPs provide
       a fixed IP address for home lines.)
     * A dedicated web server is typically maintained by a third party.

   For all these reasons, finding a good hosting provider is a key part of
   building your website. Examine the various services companies offer.
   Choose one that fits your needs and budget. (Services range from free
   to thousands of dollars per month.) You can find more details
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_
   and_setup/How_much_does_it_cost#hosting]in this article.

   Once you have web hosting service, you must
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_
   and_setup/Upload_files_to_a_web_server]upload your files to your web
   server.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanic
s/What_is_a_web_server#communicating_through_http]Communicating through HTTP

   Second, a web server provides support for
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP]HTTP (Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol). As its name implies, HTTP specifies how to transfer
   hypertext (linked web documents) between two computers.

   A [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol]Protocol
   is a set of rules for communication between two computers. HTTP is a
   textual, stateless protocol.

   Textual
          All commands are plain-text and human-readable.

   Stateless
          Neither the server nor the client remember previous
          communications. For example, relying on HTTP alone, a server
          can't remember a password you typed or remember your progress on
          an incomplete transaction. You need an application server for
          tasks like that. (We'll cover that sort of technology in other
          articles.)

   HTTP provides clear rules for how a client and server communicate.
   We'll cover HTTP itself in a
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP]technical article
   later. For now, just be aware of these things:
     * Usually only clients make HTTP requests, and only to servers.
       Servers respond to a client's HTTP request. A server can also
       populate data into a client cache, in advance of it being
       requested, through a mechanism called
       [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2_Server_Push]server push.
     * When requesting a file via HTTP, clients must provide the file's
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL]URL.
     * The web server must answer every HTTP request, at least with an
       error message.

   On a web server, the HTTP server is responsible for processing and
   answering incoming requests.
    1. Upon receiving a request, an HTTP server checks if the requested
       URL matches an existing file.
    2. If so, the web server sends the file content back to the browser.
       If not, the server will check if it should generate a file
       dynamically for the request (see
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/We
       b_mechanics/What_is_a_web_server#static_vs._dynamic_content]Static
       vs. dynamic content).
    3. If neither of these options are possible, the web server returns an
       error message to the browser, most commonly
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404]404
       Not Found. The 404 error is so common that some web designers
       devote considerable time and effort to designing 404 error pages.

       MDN 404 page as an example of such error page

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanic
s/What_is_a_web_server#static_vs._dynamic_content]Static vs. dynamic content

   Roughly speaking, a server can serve either static or dynamic content.
   Remember that the term static means "served as-is". Static websites are
   the easiest to set up, so we suggest you make your first site a static
   site.

   The term dynamic means that the server processes the content or even
   generates it on the fly from a database. This approach provides more
   flexibility, but the technical stack is more complex, making it
   dramatically more challenging to build a website.

   It is impossible to suggest a single off-the-shelf application server
   that will be the right solution for every possible use case. Some
   application servers are designed to host and manage blogs, wikis, or
   e-commerce solutions, while others are more generic. If you're building
   a dynamic website, take the time to research your requirements and find
   the technology that best fits your needs.

   Most website developers won't need to create an application server from
   scratch, because there are so many off-the-shelf solutions, many of
   which are highly configurable. But if you do need to create your own
   server, then you will probably want to use a server framework,
   leveraging its existing code and libraries, and extending just the
   parts that you need in order to meet your use case. Only a relatively
   small number of developers should need to develop a server completely
   from scratch: for example, in order to meet tight resource constraints
   on an embedded system. If you'd like to experiment with building a
   server, take a look through the resources in the
