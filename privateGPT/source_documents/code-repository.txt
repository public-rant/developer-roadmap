How to choose the best source code repository

   Your guide to selecting a code repository solution for your team
   source code

Choosing a repository tool

   There are a variety of modern software repository hosting tools
   available to choose from. Each code repository system has its own
   strength and weaknesses. Additionally, each repository hosting tool has
   various support for underlying version control systems. This guide is
   intended to walk you through the requirements that may impact which
   code repository management tool is best suited for your team’s needs.
   code management software vs version control software

The difference between a repository hosting services and a version control
system

   It is important to acknowledge that repository hosting services and
   version control systems are two separate entities. Version control
   systems are the low level command line utilities that are used to
   manage the software development life cycle changes to a collection of
   source code files.

   Learn how to pick the best
   [https://bitbucket.org/product/version-control-software]version control
   system for your team.

   Repository hosting services are third-party web applications that wrap
   and enhance a version control system. You cannot fully utilize a
   repository hosting service without using an underlying version control
   system.

Which source code repository should I choose?

   A repository hosting service is an organizational management tool which
   offers a transparent view into the traditionally opaque workflow
   process of software development. A good repository hosting service will
   provide tools for measuring, monitoring, discussing and managing
   software development efficiency and correctness. A repository hosting
   service should integrate with other management tools such as Task
   management, Customer relationship management, and support ticket
   management tools to provide a connected organizational communication
   network. Whether your business treats software development as an asset
   or liability it is important to have insight into that risk source.

Elements for consideration when selecting a repository

   Code repository hosting services are all similar in their surface level
   offerings. It can be confusing to determine what is the best repository
   hosting option for a projects specific needs. The following section
   discusses points of consideration when evaluating if a code repository
   hosting service is right for you.
     __________________________________________________________________

Supported version control systems

   Is the repository hosting service compatible with the version control
   system in use on the project? This is a critical element to consider.
   If your project is using Git and the repository service doesn’t offer
   Git support, it would be very challenging to use that repository
   hosting service.
   Team Icon

Team size and access control

   Consider the project’s team structure and working dynamic. Is this a
   one man operation or a team project? Is this a remote team? Is the team
   all onsite in the same location? What level of access do team members
   need to the repository hosting service?
   Clock icon

Release schedule

   Will there be frequent small updates or larger smaller periodic
   releases? Many repository hosting services offer CI/CD add-on tools.
   Additionally the repository service may offer issue tracking and
   release management tools.
   Database storage icon

Project size and data storage

   Is the project going to be dealing with large binary data files such as
   3D modeling graphics or Audio files? There are special repository
   softwares that specialize in making large files easier to work with.
   What is the ongoing volume of commits that will happen on the project?
   Is it an established project with a long history that can take some
   time to download?
   Building blocks

External tools and 3rd party integrations

   A key feature of a repository hosting service is the integration of
   external tools and services. These integrations really enable the power
   user workflows of a repository service. Some examples of common
   external integrations are: ticketing and task management. Customer
   support management tools. Automated quality assurance tools. If your
   team is already using a particular tool, ensure the code repository
   integrates with it well.

Selecting a code repository that compliments your organization

   The repository hosting service industry is competitive and has many
   offerings. That said there is no single “best” option. Looking for a
   “best” option means finding an offering that is complementary to the
   immediate requirements of the project at hand.

   A complementary repository hosting service is one that partners well
   with the organizational culture and workflow expectations. If the
   organization strives to follow agile practices it is important that the
   repository tool matches this. The code repository tool should match the
   organization’s “release rhythm”. If the organization has a rapid
   release continuous integration schedule, or maybe a less frequent
   static release schedule. The repository tool should accommodate these
   workflows. By identifying these consideration points upfront, it makes
   selecting a repository hosting tool a straightforward exercise.
