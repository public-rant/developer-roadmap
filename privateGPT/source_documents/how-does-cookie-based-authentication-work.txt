   What would be a step-by-step description of how cookie-based
   authentication work?

   I've never done anything involving either authentication or cookies.
   What does the browser need to do? What does the server need to do? In
   what order? How do we keep things secure?

   I've been reading about different types of authentication and about
   cookies, but I would like a basic description of how to use the two
   together. I've only read that they are often used together, but I could
   not find a description of how.

   [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17769011/how-does-cookie-based-aut
   hentication-work/17769061#17769061]Conor's answer and add a little bit
   more to the discussion...

     Can someone give me a step by step description of how cookie based
     authentication works? I've never done anything involving either
     authentication or cookies. What does the browser need to do? What
     does the server need to do? In what order? How do we keep things
     secure?

   Step 1: Client > Signing up

   Before anything else, the user has to sign up. The client posts a HTTP
   request to the server containing his/her username and password.

   Step 2: Server > Handling sign up

   The server receives this request and hashes the password before storing
   the username and password in your database. This way, if someone gains
   access to your database they won't see your users' actual passwords.

   Step 3: Client > User login

   Now your user logs in. He/she provides their username/password and
   again, this is posted as a HTTP request to the server.

   Step 4: Server > Validating login

   The server looks up the username in the database, hashes the supplied
   login password, and compares it to the previously hashed password in
   the database. If it doesn't check out, we may deny them access by
   [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1959947/whats-an-appropriate-http-
   status-code-to-return-by-a-rest-api-service-for-a-val]sending a 401
   status code and ending the request.

   Step 5: Server > Generating access token

   If everything checks out, we're going to create an access token, which
   uniquely identifies the user's session. Still in the server, we do two
   things with the access token:
    1. Store it in the database associated with that user
    2. Attach it to a response cookie to be returned to the client. Be
       sure to set an expiration date/time to limit the user's session

   Henceforth, the cookies will be attached to every request (and
   response) made between the client and server.

   Step 6: Client > Making page requests

   Back on the client side, we are now logged in. Every time the client
   makes a request for a page that requires authorization (i.e. they need
   to be logged in), the server obtains the access token from the cookie
   and checks it against the one in the database associated with that
   user. If it checks out, access is granted.

   This should get you started. Be sure to clear the cookies upon logout!

       Thanks for the description. I just wonder how does access token
       provides security? Can an attacker if steals the cookie, pose as an
       authenticated logged in user? Or that is protected by SSL?

       @Richeek SSL secures interception during requests/responses, but an
       attacker might access your cookies at the endpoints (e.g. your
       browser). Theoretically, they could then pose as a logged in user
       until the cookie expires. I say “theoretically” because the
       implementation above doesn’t handle that. In the above
       implementation, the attacker will have access until the access
       token in your database is updated (i.e. next login).

       You might invalidate the access token upon expiry yourself, perhaps
       with an “expiration date” in your database. Or, you could consider
       using
       [http://techarena51.com/index.php/json-web-token-authentication-wit
       h-flask-and-angularjs/]JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which are like access
       tokens, but can handle token expiry among other things.
       [http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html#
       rfc.section.4.1.4]More on JWT here. An attacker will still have
       access to your account for brief periods of time if they have your
       access token/JWT, so you should also secure your endpoints.

       @ManuChadha you could along with the token/session key also save
       the user's ip address along with other identifying parameters such
       as user-agent, etc. if the request then comes with a valid cookie
       but from the wrong ip, browser, etc then you deny the request and
       redirect the user to the login page to authenticate again.

       It is best practice to hash passwords client-side to further reduce
       any risk of snooping.

   A cookie is basically just an item in a dictionary. Each item has a key
   and a value. For authentication, the key could be something like
   'username' and the value would be the username. Each time you make a
   request to a website, your browser will include the cookies in the
   request, and the host server will check the cookies. So authentication
   can be done automatically like that.

   To set a cookie, you just have to add it to the response the server
   sends back after requests. The browser will then add the cookie upon
   receiving the response.

   There are different options you can configure for the cookie server
   side, like expiration times or encryption. An encrypted cookie is often
   referred to as a signed cookie. Basically the server encrypts the key
   and value in the dictionary item, so only the server can make use of
   the information. So then cookie would be secure.

   A browser will save the cookies set by the server. In the HTTP header
   of every request the browser makes to that server, it will add the
   cookies. It will only add cookies for the domains that set them.
   Example.com can set a cookie and also add options in the HTTP header
   for the browsers to send the cookie back to subdomains, like
   sub.example.com. It would be unacceptable for a browser to ever sends
   cookies to a different domain.

     * What i understand is that the browser are able to send the cookie
       back to the same domain. In relation to that does browser take
       subdomain in account when differentiate between two domains?

   Cookie-Based Authentication

   Cookie-based
   [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/authentication#Noun]authentication
   normally works in these four steps:
    1. The user provides a username and password in the login form and the
       client/browser sends a login request.
    2. After the request is made, the server validates the user on the
       backend by querying the database. If the request is valid, it will
       create a session by using the user information fetched from the
       database and store them. For each session a unique ID called the
       session ID is created. By default, the session ID will be given to
       the client through the browser.
    3. The browser will submit this session ID on each subsequent request.
       The session ID is verified against the database. Based on this
       session ID, the server will identify the session belonging to which
       client and then give the request access.
    4. Once a user logs out of the app, the session is destroyed both
       client-side and server-side.
