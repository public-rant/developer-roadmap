     * Amazing course! I love the "learn by doing approach" that it has.
       Furthermore, the answers to the questions asked in the forum are
       very informative. It's very fantastic, and it gave me a foundation
       to learn more about HTML. I am so glad that I found it, and other
       beginners should give it a try!

     * This was by far the best course I have ever taken for HTML! I was
       able to get help with the videos and the "get unstuck" button. It
       kept me so interested the whole time. I was at my computer for 2
       days straight because I didn't want to stop! Thank you so much
       Codecademy!
