How has it evolved over the years
Let s take a look
from HTTP 1 to 1 1 to 2 and now to HTTP 3
HTTP 1 came out in 1996
Every request to the same server requires a separate TCP connection
It introduced nbsp a keep alive mechanism
The nbsp persistent connections reduce request latency
expensive TCP three way handshake for every request
added HTTP pipelining
before waiting for each response
It was tricky nbsp to implement correctly
Its support was eventually removed from many web browsers
Without align blocking
must wait for the previous requests to complete
all subsequent requests on the same connection are also impacted
browsers normally keep multiple TCP connections
HTTP 2 was published in 2015
could be sent to the same server on a single TCP connection
each stream is independent of each other
HTTP 2 solves the headline blocking issue at the nbsp application layer
Also note that HTTP 2 introduced a push capability
without requiring a client to poll
and has nbsp recently been published in June 2022
instead nbsp of TCP as the underlying transport protocol
It introduces streams as nbsp the first class citizen at the transport layer
so no additional handshakes are required
QUIC streams are delivered independently
doesn t affect others
QUIC is designed for mobile heavy internet usage
as they move about their day
from one network to another is sluggish nbsp
which allows connections to move between
Even though HTTP 3 has just been standardized
