   An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and
   computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all
   the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process
   management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral
   devices such as disk drives and printers.

   An operating system is software that enables applications to interact
   with a computer's hardware. The software that contains the core
   components of the operating system is called the kernel.

   The primary purposes of an Operating System are to enable applications
   (spftwares) to interact with a computer's hardware and to manage a
   system's hardware and software resources.

   Some popular Operating Systems include Linux Operating System, Windows
   Operating System, VMS, OS/400, AIX, z/OS, etc. Today, Operating systems
   is found almost in every device like mobile phones, personal computers,
   mainframe computers, automobiles, TV, Toys etc.

Definitions

   We can have a number of definitions of an Operating System. Let's go
   through few of them:

     An Operting System is the low-level software that supports a
     computer's basic functions, such as scheduling tasks and controlling
     peripherals.

   We can refine this definition as follows:

     An operating system is a program that acts as an interface between
     the user and the computer hardware and controls the execution of all
     kinds of programs.

   Following is another definition taken from Wikipedia:

     An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer
     hardware, software resources, and provides common services for
     computer programs.

Architecture

   We can draw a generic architecture diagram of an Operating System which
   is as follows:
   Conceptual view of an Operating System

Operating System Generations

   Operating systems have been evolving over the years. We can categorise
   this evaluation based on different generations which is briefed below:

0^th Generation

   The term 0^th generation is used to refer to the period of development
   of computing when Charles Babbage invented the Analytical Engine and
   later John Atanasoff created a computer in 1940. The hardware component
   technology of this period was electronic vacuum tubes. There was no
   Operating System available for this generation computer and computer
   programs were written in machine language. This computers in this
   generation were inefficient and dependent on the varying competencies
   of the individual programmer as operators.

First Generation (1951-1956)

   The first generation marked the beginning of commercial computing
   including the introduction of Eckert and Mauchly’s UNIVAC I in early
   1951, and a bit later, the IBM 701.

   System operation was performed with the help of expert operators and
   without the benefit of an operating system for a time though programs
   began to be written in higher level, procedure-oriented languages, and
   thus the operator’s routine expanded. Later mono-programmed operating
   system was developed, which eliminated some of the human intervention
   in running job and provided programmers with a number of desirable
   functions. These systems still continued to operate under the control
   of a human operator who used to follow a number of steps to execute a
   program. Programming language like FORTRAN was developed by John W.
   Backus in 1956.

Second Generation (1956-1964)

   The second generation of computer hardware was most notably
   characterised by transistors replacing vacuum tubes as the hardware
   component technology. The first operating system GMOS was developed by
   the IBM computer. GMOS was based on single stream batch processing
   system, because it collects all similar jobs in groups or batches and
   then submits the jobs to the operating system using a punch card to
   complete all jobs in a machine. Operating system is cleaned after
   completing one job and then continues to read and initiates the next
   job in punch card.

   Researchers began to experiment with multiprogramming and
   multiprocessing in their computing services called the time-sharing
   system. A noteworthy example is the Compatible Time Sharing System
   (CTSS), developed at MIT during the early 1960s.

Third Generation (1964-1979)

   The third generation officially began in April 1964 with IBM’s
   announcement of its System/360 family of computers. Hardware technology
   began to use integrated circuits (ICs) which yielded significant
   advantages in both speed and economy.

   Operating system development continued with the introduction and
   widespread adoption of multiprogramming. The idea of taking fuller
   advantage of the computer’s data channel I/O capabilities continued to
   develop.

   Another progress which leads to developing of personal computers in
   fourth generation is a new development of minicomputers with DEC PDP-1.
   The third generation was an exciting time, indeed, for the development
   of both computer hardware and the accompanying operating system.

Fourth Generation (1979 – Present)

   The fourth generation is characterised by the appearance of the
   personal computer and the workstation. The component technology of the
   third generation, was replaced by very large scale integration (VLSI).
   Many Operating Systems which we are using today like Windows, Linux,
   MacOS etc developed in the fourth generation.

   Following are some of important functions of an operating System.
     * Memory Management
     * Processor Management
     * Device Management
     * File Management
     * Network Management
     * Security
     * Control over system performance
     * Job accounting
     * Error detecting aids
     * Coordination between other software and users

Memory Management

   Memory management refers to management of Primary Memory or Main
   Memory. Main memory is a large array of words or bytes where each word
   or byte has its own address.

   Main memory provides a fast storage that can be accessed directly by
   the CPU. For a program to be executed, it must in the main memory. An
   Operating System does the following activities for memory management −
     * Keeps tracks of primary memory, i.e., what part of it are in use by
       whom, what part are not in use.
     * In multiprogramming, the OS decides which process will get memory
       when and how much.
     * Allocates the memory when a process requests it to do so.
     * De-allocates the memory when a process no longer needs it or has
       been terminated.

Processor Management

   In multiprogramming environment, the OS decides which process gets the
   processor when and for how much time. This function is called process
   scheduling. An Operating System does the following activities for
   processor management −
     * Keeps tracks of processor and status of process. The program
       responsible for this task is known as traffic controller.
     * Allocates the processor (CPU) to a process.
     * De-allocates processor when a process is no longer required.

Device Management

   An Operating System manages device communication via their respective
   drivers. It does the following activities for device management −
     * Keeps tracks of all devices. Program responsible for this task is
       known as the I/O controller.
     * Decides which process gets the device when and for how much time.
     * Allocates the device in the efficient way.
     * De-allocates devices.

File Management

   A file system is normally organized into directories for easy
   navigation and usage. These directories may contain files and other
   directions.

   An Operating System does the following activities for file management −
     * Keeps track of information, location, uses, status etc. The
       collective facilities are often known as file system.
     * Decides who gets the resources.
     * Allocates the resources.
     * De-allocates the resources.

Other Important Activities

   Following are some of the important activities that an Operating System
   performs −
     * Security − By means of password and similar other techniques, it
       prevents unauthorized access to programs and data.
     * Control over system performance − Recording delays between request
       for a service and response from the system.
     * Job accounting − Keeping track of time and resources used by
       various jobs and users.
     * Error detecting aids − Production of dumps, traces, error messages,
       and other debugging and error detecting aids.
     * Coordination between other softwares and users − Coordination and
       assignment of compilers, interpreters, assemblers and other
       software to the various users of the computer systems.
