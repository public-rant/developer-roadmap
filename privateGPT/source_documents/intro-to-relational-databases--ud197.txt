About this course

   This course is a quick, fun introduction to using a relational database
   from your code, using examples in Python. You'll learn the basics of
   SQL (the Structured Query Language) and database design, as well as the
   Python API for connecting Python code to a database. You'll also learn
   a bit about protecting your database-backed web apps from common
   security problems.

   After taking this course, you'll be able to write code using a database
   as a backend to store application data reliably and safely.

What you will learn

    1. Data and Tables
          + Learn about how relational databases let you structure data
            into tables.
          + Learn about the importance of unique keys and relationships
            between tables.
    2. Elements of SQL
          + Begin learning SQL, the Structured Query Language used by most
            relational databases.
          + Learn about the select and insert statements, the basic
            operations for reading and writing data.
          + Learn about the operators and syntax available to get the
            database to scan and join tables for you.
    3. Python DB-API
          + Learn how to access a relational database from Python code.
          + Use a virtual machine (VM) to run a Python web application
            with a database.
          + Common security pitfalls of database applications, including
            the famous Bobby Tables.
    4. Deeper Into SQL
          + Learn how to design and create new databases.
          + Learn about normalized design, which makes it easier to write
            effective code using a database.
          + Learn how to use the SQL join operators to rapidly connect
            data from different tables.

Prerequisites and requirements

   You can read and write basic code in Python. This course uses
   programming exercises in Python. If you haven't worked with Python
   before, check out our course
   [https://www.udacity.com/course/ud036]Programming Foundations with
   Python.

   If you can understand this code (maybe with the help of the
   [https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html#random.choice]random
   module documentation), you know enough Python for this course:
import random

def ChooseTwice(items):
    a = random.choice(items)
    b = random.choice(items)
    return a, b

names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Debra"]
(one, two) = ChooseTwice(names)
if one == two:
    print "%s is happy!" % one
else:
    print "%s likes %s!" % (one, two)

   You can use a command-line interface (terminal). Some of the exercises
   in this course involve using a Unix-style command-line interface to
   enter commands, run Python programs, and navigate directories.

   If you have taken our course on
   [https://www.udacity.com/course/ud775]Git and Github, the level of
   command-line use in this course is similar.

   You don't need to be a Web programmer. This course does include a small
   Web application and some HTML and JavaScript in examples, but you will
   not need to make changes in these languages.

   You don't need any previous database experience. This course is an
   entry-level introduction to relational databases.

   You need a programming text editor (such as
   [http://www.sublimetext.com/]Sublime Text) installed on your computer.
   You should be able to use it to open and edit files of Python code.

   See the [https://www.udacity.com/tech/requirements]Technology
   Requirements for using Udacity.

Why take this course?

   If you look under the hood of a lot of major web sites — from Wikipedia
   to Reddit — you'll find a relational database somewhere.

   Database systems such as PostgreSQL and MySQL have been part of the web
   developer's toolkit for many years, and remain some of the most
   powerful tools available for storing and manipulating structured data.

   If you're planning to continue on in full-stack development, knowing
   about databases is essential background. Even though many toolkits hide
   the details of the database from your application code, being able to
   interact with the database will serve you well in designing, debugging,
   and maintaining your applications.
