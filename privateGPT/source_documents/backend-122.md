Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a technology that allows a web server to push data to a client in real-time. It uses an HTTP connection to send a stream of data from the server to the client, and the client can listen for these events and take action when they are received.
SSE is useful for applications that require real-time updates, such as chat systems, stock tickers, and social media feeds. It is a simple and efficient way to establish a long-lived connection between a client and a server, and it is supported by most modern web browsers.
To use SSE, the client must create an EventSource object and specify the URL of the server-side script that will send the events. The server can then send events by writing them to the response stream with the proper formatting.

Apache is a free, open-source HTTP server, available on many operating systems, but mainly used on Linux distributions. It is one of the most popular options for web developers, as it accounts for over 30% of all the websites, as estimated by W3Techs.

Web servers can be either hardware or software, or perhaps a combination of the two.
A hardware web server is a computer that houses web server software and the files that make up a website (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files). A web server establishes a connection to the Internet and facilitates the physical data exchange with other web-connected devices.
A software web server has a number of software components that regulate how hosted files are accessed by online users. This is at the very least an HTTP server. Software that knows and understands HTTP and URLs (web addresses) is known as an HTTP server (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). The content of these hosted websites is sent to the end user’s device through an HTTP server, which may be accessed via the domain names of the websites it holds.
Basically, an HTTP request is made by a browser anytime it wants a file that is stored on a web server. The relevant (hardware) web server receives the request, which is then accepted by the appropriate (software) HTTP server, which then locates the requested content and returns it to the browser over HTTP. (If the server cannot locate the requested page, it responds with a 404 error.)
