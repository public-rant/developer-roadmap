   Browser is pivotal in the functioning of any website. Right from how
   the application renders to how it functions, everything depends on the
   Browser and its functioning. To deliver a seamless user experience with
   [https://www.browserstack.com/guide/cross-browser-compatibility-testing
   -beyond-chrome]cross browser compatibility testing, it is essential to
   understand the role of rendering engines in browsers.

   Before diving into the role of a rendering engine in browsers, let’s
   quickly understand the underlying architecture of a web browser.

Understanding the Architecture of Web Browsers

   Browsers are built of FrontEnd and BackEnd. While the FrontEnd ensures
   how the webpage appears on the browser, the backend handles the
   requests and is the carrier of information. Its different components
   work in coordination to deliver a seamless web experience.

   Each browser is made up of 7 different components:
    1. User Interface
    2. Browser Engine
    3. Rendering Engine
    4. Networking
    5. JavaScript Interpreter
    6. UI Backend
    7. Data Persistence

Architecture of Web Browsers Architecture of Web Browsers Components of Web
Browser

   Web Browsers consist of 7 different components listed below:

1. User Interface

   This component allows end-users to interact with all visual elements
   available on the web page. The visual elements include the address bar,
   home button, next button, and all other elements that fetch and display
   the web page requested by the end-user.

2. Browser Engine

   It is a core component of every web browser. The browser engine
   functions as an intermediary or a bridge between the user interface and
   the rendering engine. It queries and handles the rendering engine as
   per the inputs received from the user interface.

   The performance and features of a browser engine can greatly impact the
   user experience of a web browser. A fast and efficient browser engine
   can help web pages load quickly and smoothly, while a slower or less
   capable engine may struggle to render complex pages or provide a smooth
   browsing experience.

3. Rendering Engine

   As the name suggests, this component is responsible for rendering a
   specific web page requested by the user on their screen. It interprets
   HTML and XML documents along with images that are styled or formatted
   using CSS, and a final layout is generated, which is displayed on the
   user interface.

   Note: Every browser has its own unique rendering engine. Rendering
   engines might also differ for different browser versions. The list
   below mentions browser engines used by a few common browsers:
    1. Google Chrome and Opera v.15+: Blink
    2. Internet Explorer: Trident
    3. Mozilla Firefox: Gecko
    4. Chrome for iOS and Safari: WebKit

4. Networking

   This component is responsible for managing network calls using standard
   protocols like HTTP or FTP. It also looks after security issues
   associated with internet communication.

5. JavaScript Interpreter

   As the name suggests, it is responsible for parsing and executing the
   JavaScript code embedded in a website. Once the interpreted results are
   generated, they are forwarded to the rendering engine for display on
   the user interface.

6. UI Backend

   This component uses the user interface methods of the underlying
   operating system. It is mainly used for drawing basic widgets (windows
   and combo boxes).

7. Data Storage/Persistence

   It is a persistent layer. A web browser needs to store various types of
   data locally, for example, cookies. As a result, browsers must be
   compatible with data storage mechanisms such as WebSQL, IndexedDB,
   FileSystem, etc.

   Now that we are aware of the key components involved in building a web
   browser let’s dig deep into the role of the rendering engine.

Role of Rendering Engine

   Once a user requests a particular document, the rendering engine starts
   fetching the content of the requested document. This is done via the
   networking layer. The rendering engine starts receiving the content of
   that specific document in chunks of 8 KBs from the networking layer.
   After this, the basic flow of the rendering engine begins.

   Browser rendering engine Browser rendering engine

   The four basic steps include:
    1. The requested HTML page is parsed in chunks, including the external
       CSS files and in style elements, by the rendering engine. The HTML
       elements are then converted into DOM nodes to form a “content tree”
       or “DOM tree.”
    2. Simultaneously, the browser also creates a render tree. This tree
       includes both the styling information as well as the visual
       instructions that define the order in which the elements will be
       displayed. The render tree ensures that the content is displayed in
       the desired order.
    3. Further, the render tree goes through the layout process. When a
       render tree is created, the position or size values are not
       assigned. The entire process of calculating values for evaluating
       the desired position is called a layout process. In this process,
       every node is assigned the exact coordinates. This ensures that
       every node appears at an accurate position on the screen.
    4. The final step is to paint the screen, wherein the render tree is
       traversed, and the renderer’s paint() method is invoked, which
       paints each node on the screen using the UI backend layer.

   As discussed earlier, every browser has its own unique rendering
   engine. So naturally, every browser has its own way of interpreting web
   pages on a user’s screen. Here’s where a challenge arises for web
   developers regarding the cross-browser compatibility of their website.

   This is where cross-browser testing comes into the picture.

   [https://www.browserstack.com/live]Cross browser testing is a quality
   assurance method used to verify the consistency of web applications in
   terms of functionality and design across multiple browsers. These tests
   enable QA teams to explore any issues by conducting a
   [https://www.browserstack.com/responsive]responsive test, that may
   occur when their website is accessed via different browsers or browser
   versions.

   [https://www.browserstack.com/users/sign_up?ref=guide-browser-rendering

   Organizations and teams can leverage online platforms like BrowserStack
   for performing
   [https://www.browserstack.com/guide/cross-browser-compatibility-testing
   -beyond-chrome]cross browser compatibility testing across a wide range
   of real browsers and devices. For example, one can perform
   [https://www.browserstack.com/test-on-microsoft-edge-browser]Edge
   Testing on Windows 10 to ensure that their web-app performs flawlessly
   on Microsoft Edge.

   By understanding how a rendering engine works, web developers can gain
   greater insight into how websites operate. Consequently, they can
   develop, design, and deploy content more efficiently. If one
   comprehends the nuance of how web content is displayed on a user’s
   screen by various browsers, one is simply more equipped to create
   content that is compatible with multiple browsers.
