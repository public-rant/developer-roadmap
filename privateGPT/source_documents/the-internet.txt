What is the internet?

   The internet is the world’s most popular computer network. It began as
   an academic research project in 1969, and became a global commercial
   network in the 1990s. Today it is used by more than 2 billion people
   around the world.

   The internet is notable for its decentralization. No one owns the
   internet or controls who can connect to it. Instead, thousands of
   different organizations operate their own networks and negotiate
   voluntary interconnection agreements.

   Most people access internet content using a web browser. Indeed, the
   web has become so popular that many people incorrectly treat the
   internet and the web as synonymous. But in reality, the web is just one
   of many internet applications. Other popular Internet applications
   include email and BitTorrent.

Where is the internet?

   The internet has three basic parts:
     * The last mile is the part of the internet that connects homes and
       small businesses to the internet. Currently,
       [http://www.leichtmanresearch.com/research/notes03_2015.pdf]about
       60 percent of residential internet connections in the United States
       are provided by cable TV companies such as Comcast and Time Warner.
       Of the remaining 40 percent, a growing fraction use new fiber optic
       cables, most of which are part of Verizon’s FiOS program or AT&T’s
       U-Verse. Finally, a significant but shrinking number use outdated
       DSL service provided over telephone cables.
       The last mile also includes the towers that allow people to access
       the internet with their cell phones. Wireless internet service
       accounts for a large and growing share of all internet usage.
     * Data centers are rooms full of servers that store user data and
       host online apps and content. Some are owned by large companies
       such as Google and Facebook. Others are commercial facilities that
       provide service to many smaller websites. Data centers have very
       fast internet connections, allowing them to serve many users
       simultaneously. Data centers can be located anywhere in the world,
       but they are often located in remote areas where land and
       electricity are cheap. For example,
       [http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2013/12/02/in-iowa-a-f
       ield-becomes-a-huge-google-server-farm/]Google,

       acebook, and
       [http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/06/microsoft-iowa-data-c
       enter/]Microsoft have all constructed vast data centers in Iowa.
     * The backbone consists of long-distance networks — mostly on fiber
       optic cables — that carry data between data centers and consumers.
       The backbone market is highly competitive. Backbone providers
       frequently connect their networks together at
       [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_exchange_points_by_
       size]internet exchange points, usually located in major cities.
       Establishing a presence at IEPs makes it much easier for backbone
       providers to improve their connections to others.

Who created the internet?

   The internet began as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET]ARPANET,
   an academic research network that was funded by the military’s Advanced
   Research Projects Agency (ARPA, now DARPA). The project was led by
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)]Bob
   Taylor, an ARPA administrator, and the network was built by the
   consulting firm of Bolt, Beranek and Newman. It began operations in
   1969.

   In 1973, software engineers
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf]Vint Cerf and
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn]Bob Kahn began work on the next
   generation of networking standards for the ARPANET. These standards,
   known as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite]TCP/IP,
   became the foundation of the modern internet. ARPANET switched to using
   TCP/IP on January 1, 1983.

   During the 1980s, funding for the internet shifted from the military to
   the [http://www.nsf.gov/]National Science Foundation. The NSF funded
   the long-distance networks that served as the internet’s backbone from
   1981 until 1994. In 1994, the Clinton Administration
   [http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/24/business/us-begins-privatizing-inter
   net-s-operations.html]turned control over the internet backbone to the
   private sector. It has been privately operated and funded ever since.

Did Al Gore invent the internet?

   Former Vice President Al Gore is frequently quoted as claiming credit
   for the invention of the internet, but what he actually said in a
   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnFJ8cHAlco]1999 CNN interview was “I
   took the initiative in creating the internet.” Gore was widely mocked
   for this statement. But the men who did invent the internet, TCP/IP
   designers Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf,
   [http://amsterdam.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0009/msg00311.ht
   ml]wrote in Gore’s defense in 2000. They argue that Gore was “the first
   political leader to recognize the importance of the internet and to
   promote and support its development.”

   “As far back as the 1970s Congressman Gore promoted the idea of high
   speedtelecommunications,” the pair wrote. “As a Senator in the 1980s
   Gore urged government agencies to consolidate what at the time were
   several dozen different and unconnected networks into an ‘Interagency
   Network.’” Gore sponsored the 1991
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Performance_Computing_Act_of_1991]H
   igh Performance Computing and Communications Act, which Kahn and Cerf
   say “became one of the major vehicles for the spread of the internet
   beyond the field of computer science.“

Who runs the internet?

   No one runs the internet. It’s organized as a decentralized network of
   networks. Thousands of companies, universities, governments, and other
   entities operate their own networks and exchange traffic with each
   other based on voluntary interconnection agreements.

   The shared technical standards that make the internet work are managed
   by an organization called the [http://www.ietf.org/]Internet
   Engineering Task Force. The IETF is an open organization; anyone is
   free to attend meetings, propose new standards, and recommend changes
   to existing standards. No one is required to adopt standards endorsed
   by the IETF, but the IETF’s consensus-based decision-making process
   helps to ensure that its recommendations are generally adopted by the
   internet community.

   The [https://www.icann.org/]Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
   Numbers (ICANN) is sometimes described as being responsible for
   internet governance. As its name implies, ICANN is in charge of
   distributing domain names (like vox.com) and
   [http://www.vox.com/cards/the-internet/whats-an-ip-address]IP
   addresses. But ICANN doesn’t control who can connect to the internet or
   what kind of information can be sent over it.

What’s an IP address?

   Internet Protocol addresses are numbers that computers use to identify
   each other on the internet. For example, an IP address for vox.com is
   216.146.46.10.

   An ICANN department known as the [https://www.iana.org/]Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority is responsible for distributing IP addresses
   to ensure that two different organizations don’t use the same address.

What is IPv6?

   The current internet standard, known as IPv4, only allows for about 4
   billion IP addresses. This was considered a very big number in the
   1970s, but today, the supply of IPv4 addresses is nearly exhausted.

   So internet engineers have developed a new standard called
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6]IPv6. IPv6 allows for a
   mind-boggling number of unique addresses — the exact figure is
   [http://royal.pingdom.com/2009/05/26/the-number-of-possible-ipv6-addres
   ses-read-out-loud/]39 digits long — ensuring that the world will never
   again run out.

   At first, the transition to IPv6 was slow. Technical work on the
   standard was completed in the 1990s, but the internet community faced a
   serious chicken-and-egg problem: as long as most people were using
   IPv4, there was little incentive for anyone to switch to IPv6.

   But as IPv4 addresses became scarce, IPv6 adoption accelerated. The
   [https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html]fraction of users
   who connected to Google via IPv6 grew from 1 percent at the beginning
   of 2013 to 6 percent in mid-2015.

How does wireless internet work?

   In its early years, internet access was carried over physical cables.
   But more recently, wireless internet access has become increasingly
   common.

   There are two basic types of wireless internet access: wifi and
   cellular. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi]Wifi networks are
   relatively simple. Anyone can purchase wifi networking equipment in
   order to provide internet access in a home or business. Wifi networks
   use unlicensed spectrum: electromagnetic frequencies that are available
   for anyone to use without charge. To prevent neighbors’ networks from
   interfering with each other, there are strict limits on the power (and
   therefore the range) of wifi networks.

   Cellular networks are more centralized. They work by breaking up the
   service territory into cells. In the densest areas, cells can be as
   small as a single city block; in rural areas a cell can be miles
   across. Each cell has a tower at its center providing services to
   devices there. When a device moves from one cell to another, the
   network automatically hands off the device from one tower to another,
   allowing the user to continue communicating without interruption.

   Cells are too large to use the unlicensed, low-power spectrum used by
   wifi networks. Instead, cellular networks use spectrum licensed for
   their exclusive use. Because this spectrum is scarce, it is usually
   awarded by auction. Wireless auctions have
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_2008_wireless_spectrum_auc
   tion]generated tens of billions of dollars in revenue for the US
   treasury since the first one was held in 1994.

What is the cloud?

   The cloud describes an approach to computing that has become popular in
   the early 2000s. By storing files on servers and delivering software
   over the internet, cloud computing provides users with a simpler, more
   reliable computing experience. Cloud computing allows consumers and
   businesses to treat computing as a utility, leaving the technical
   details to technology companies.

   For example, in the 1990s, many people used Microsoft Office to edit
   documents and spreadsheets. They stored documents on their hard drives.
   And when a new version of Microsoft Office was released, customers had
   to purchase it and manually install it on their PCs.

   In contrast, Google Docs is a cloud office suite. When a user visits
   docs.google.com, she automatically gets the latest version of Google
   Docs. Because her files are stored on Google’s servers, they’re
   available from any computer. Even better, she doesn’t have to worry
   about losing her files in a hard drive crash. (Microsoft now has its
   own cloud office suite called Office 365.)

   There are many other examples. Gmail and Hotmail are cloud email
   services that have largely replaced desktop email clients such as
   Outlook. Dropbox is a cloud computing service that automatically
   synchronizes data between devices, saving people from having to carry
   files around on floppy disks. Apple’s iCloud automatically copies
   users’ music and other files from their desktop computer to their
   mobile devices, saving users the hassle of synchronizing via a USB
   connection.

   Cloud computing is having a big impact for businesses too. In the
   1990s, companies wanting to create a website needed to purchase and
   operate their own servers. But in 2006, Amazon.com launched Amazon Web
   Services, which allows customers to rent servers by the hour. That has
   lowered the barrier to entry for creating websites and made it much
   easier for sites to quickly expand capacity as they grow more popular.

What is a packet?

   A packet is the basic unit of information transmitted over the
   internet. Splitting information up into small, digestible pieces allows
   the network’s capacity to be used more efficiently.

   A packet has two parts. The
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Header]header contains information
   that helps the packet get to its destination, including the length of
   the packet, its source and destination, and a checksum value that helps
   the recipient detect if a packet was damaged in transit. After the
   header comes the actual data. A packet can contain up to 64 kilobytes
   of data, which is roughly 20 pages of plain text.

   If internet routers experience congestion or other technical problems,
   they are allowed to deal with it by simply discarding packets. It’s the
   sending computer’s responsibility to detect that a packet didn’t reach
   its destination and send another copy. This approach might seem
   counterintuitive, but it simplifies the internet’s core infrastructure,
   leading to higher performance at lower cost.

What is the World Wide Web?

   The World Wide Web is a popular way to publish information on the
   internet. The web was created by
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee]Timothy Berners-Lee, a
   computer programmer at the European scientific research organization
   [http://home.web.cern.ch/]CERN, in 1991. It offered a more powerful and
   user-friendly interface than other internet applications. The web
   supported hyperlinks, allowing users to browse from one document to
   another with a single click.

   Over time, the web became increasingly sophisticated, supporting
   images, audio, video, and interactive content. In the mid-1990s,
   companies such as Yahoo and Amazon.com began building profitable
   businesses based on the web. In the 2000s, full-featured web-based
   applications such as Yahoo Maps and Google Docs were created.

   In 1994, Berners-Lee created the [http://www.w3.org/]World Wide Web
   Consortium (W3C) to be the web’s official standards organization. He is
   still the W3C’s director and continues to oversee the development of
   web standards. However, the web is an open platform, and the W3C can’t
   compel anyone to adopt its recommendations. In practice, the
   organizations with the most influence over the web are Microsoft,
   Google, Apple, and Mozilla, the companies that produce the leading web
   browsers. Any technologies adopted by these four become de facto web
   standards.

   The web has become so popular that many people now regard it as
   synonymous with the internet itself. But technically, the web is just
   one of many internet applications. Other applications include email and
   BitTorrent.

What’s a web browser?

   A web browser is a computer program that allows users to download and
   view websites. Web browsers are available for desktop computers,
   tablets, and mobile phones.

   The first widely used browser was
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)]Mosaic, created by
   researchers at the University of Illinois. The Mosaic team moved to
   California to found [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape]Netscape,
   which built the first commercially successful web browser in 1994.

   Netscape’s popularity was soon eclipsed by Microsoft’s
   [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie]Inter
   net Explorer, but an open source version of Netscape’s browser became
   the modern [http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/]Firefox browser.
   Apple released its [https://www.apple.com/safari/]Safari browser in
   2003, and Google released a browser called
   [https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/]Chrome in 2008. By
   2015, Chrome had grown to be the
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers]most popular
   web browser with a market share around 50 percent. Internet Explorer,
   Firefox, and Safari also had significant market share.

What is SSL?

   SSL, short for Secure Sockets Layer, is a family of encryption
   technologies that allows web users to protect the privacy of
   information they transmit over the internet.

   When you visit a secure website such as Gmail.com, you'll see a lock
   next to the URL, indicating that your communications with the site are
   encrypted. Here's what that looks like in Google's Chrome browser:

   Screen_shot_2014-04-08_at_10

   That lock is supposed to signal that third parties won't be able to
   read any information you send or receive. Under the hood, SSL
   accomplishes that by transforming your data into a coded message that
   only the recipient knows how to decipher. If a malicious party is
   listening to the conversation, it will only see a seemingly random
   string of characters, not the contents of your emails, Facebook posts,
   credit card numbers, or other private information.

   SSL was introduced by Netscape in 1994. In its early years, it was only
   used on a few types of websites, such as online banking sites. By the
   early 2010s, Google, Yahoo, and Facebook all used SSL encryption for
   their websites and online services. More recently, there has been a
   movement toward making the use of SSL universal. In 2015, Mozilla
   announced that future versions of the Firefox browser would treat the
   lack of SSL encryption as a security flaw, as a way to encourage all
   websites to upgrade. Google is considering
   [https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-se
   cure]taking the same step with Chrome.

What is the Domain Name System?

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is the reason you can access Vox by typing
   vox.com into your browser rather than a hard-to-remember numeric
   address such as 216.146.46.10.

   The system is hierarchical. For example, the .com domain is
   administered by a company called Verisign. Verisign assigns sub-domains
   like google.com and vox.com. Owners of these second-level domains, in
   turn, can create sub-domains such as mail.google.com and
   maps.google.com.

   Because popular websites use domain names to identify themselves to the
   public, the security of DNS has become an increasing concern. Criminals
   and government spies alike have sought to compromise DNS in order to
   impersonate popular websites such as facebook.com and gmail.com and
   intercept their private communications. A standard called
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions]D
   NSSEC seeks to beef up DNS security with encryption, but few people
   have adopted it.

Who decides what domain names exist and who gets them?

   The domain name system is administered by the
   [https://www.icann.org/]Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
   Numbers (ICANN), a non-profit organization based in California. ICANN
   was founded in 1998. It was granted authority over DNS by the US
   Commerce Department, though it has increasingly asserted its
   independence from the US government.

   There are two types of domain names. The first is generic top-level
   domains (gTLDs) such as .com, .edu, .org, and .gov. Because the
   internet originated in the United States, these domains tend to be most
   popular there. Authority over these domains is usually delegated to
   private organizations.

   There are also country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs). Each country in
   the world has its own 2-letter code. For example, the ccTLD for the
   United States is .us, Great Britain’s is .uk, and China’s is .cn. These
   domains are administered by authorities in each country. Some ccTLDs,
   such as .tv (for the island nation of Tuvalu) and .io (the British
   Indian Ocean Territory), have become popular for use outside of their
   home countries.

   In 2011, ICANN
   [http://arstechnica.com/business/2011/06/icann-approves-plan-to-vastly-
   expand-top-level-domains/]voted to make it easier to create new gTLDs.
   As a result, there may be dozens or even hundreds of new domains in the
   next few years.

   [http://vox.com/pages/support-now?itm_campaign=default&itm_medium=artic
   le&itm_source=article-footer]Will you support Vox’s explanatory
   journalism?

   Most news outlets make their money through advertising or
   subscriptions. But when it comes to what we’re trying to do at Vox,
   there are a couple of big issues with relying on ads and subscriptions
   to keep the lights on.
   First, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy. We often
   only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which
   makes it hard to plan ahead.
   Second, we’re not in the subscriptions business. Vox is here to help
   everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world — not just the
   people who can afford to pay for a subscription. We believe that’s an
   important part of building a more equal society. And we can’t do that
   if we have a paywall.
   It’s important that we have several ways we make money, just like it’s
   important for you to have a diversified retirement portfolio to weather
   the ups and downs of the stock market. That’s why, even though
   advertising is still our biggest source of revenue, we also seek grants
   and reader support. (And no matter how our work is funded, we have
   strict guidelines on editorial independence.)
