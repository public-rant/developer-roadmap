Learn Effectively With Feedback

   The fastest way to learn any skill is with rapid feedback. Ideally an
   experienced programmer would provide this feedback, telling you right
   away whether your code is correct, and if not, how to fix it. Our
   automated system takes the place of this programmer, analyzing your
   code, checking it for correctness, and providing instant feedback.

What our learners think

   “
   I like the quick feedback!
   Coding is fun this way. I've tried picking up python a few times and
   always give up. But I absolutely loved learning this way. Awesome job.
   All this practice is really helping. I can finally write code without
   hand-holding.
