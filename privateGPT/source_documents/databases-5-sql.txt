Databases: Relational Databases and SQL

   This course is one of five self-paced courses on the topic of
   Databases, originating as one of Stanford's three inaugural massive
   open online courses released in the fall of 2011. The original
   "Databases" courses are now all available on edx.org.

   This course provides an introduction to relational databases and
   comprehensive coverage of SQL, the long-accepted standard query
   language for relational database systems.

   Databases: Advanced Topics in SQL and Databases: OLAP and Recursion are
   follow-on courses to this course and can be taken in either order.
   Advanced Topics is a broad and practical course covering indexes,
   transactions, constraints, triggers, views, and authorization, while
   OLAP and Recursion is recommended for learners with specific interest
   in these topics.

   About this course

   About the Database Series of Courses

   "Databases" was one of Stanford's three inaugural massive open online
   courses in the fall of 2011. It has been offered in synchronous and
   then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously
   since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five
   self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn
   about different aspects of databases.

   Relational Databases and SQL is the most popular course in the
   Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong
   understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the
   long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems.
   Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases
   and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and
   semistructured data.

   All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of
   them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding,
   in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked
   interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated
   discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses
   are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the
   overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases
   course.

   Why Learn About Databases

   Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by
   most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge
   number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications
   systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other
   software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of
   persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems
   provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally
   useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability,
   concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages.
   Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science
   graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful
   to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.

What you'll learn

   [https://www.edx.org/course/databases-5-sql#outcome]Skip What you'll
   learn

   Stanford's online offering in Databases is now available as a set of
   five self-paced courses:

   Databases: Relational Databases and SQL
     * Introduction to the relational model and concepts in relational
       databases and relational database management systems
     * Comprehensive coverage of SQL, the long-accepted standard query
       language for relational database management systems

   Databases: Advanced Topics in SQL (prerequisite: Relational Databases
   and SQL)
     * Creating indexes for increased query performance
     * Using transactions for concurrency control and failure recovery
     * Database constraints: key, referential integrity, and "check"
       constraints
     * Database triggers

Frequently Asked Questions

   [https://www.edx.org/course/databases-5-sql#faq]Skip Frequently Asked
   Questions

   How long will it take to go through the course material?

   All of the courses are self-paced and include videos, quizzes, and/or
   exercises. The courses vary considerably in length and complexity, and
   some students work faster than others, so we're not able to predict an
   individual time commitment.

   What background do I need?

   The series of courses does not assume prior knowledge of any specific
   topics, however a solid computer science foundation -- a reasonable
   amount of programming, as well as knowledge of basic computer science
   theory -- will make the material more accessible.

   Do I need to buy a textbook?

   Detailed lecture notes are provided. Having a textbook in addition to
   the notes is not necessary, but you might want to purchase one for
   reference, to reinforce the core material, and as a source of
   additional exercises. Suggested textbooks and readings are listed as
   part of the materials.
