A key-value database (KV database) is a type of database that stores data as a collection of key-value pairs. In a KV database, each piece of data is identified by a unique key, and the value is the data associated with that key.
KV databases are designed for fast and efficient storage and retrieval of data, and they are often used in applications that require high performance and low latency. They are particularly well-suited for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as log data and user profiles.
Some popular KV databases include Redis, Memcached, and LevelDB. These databases are often used in combination with other types of databases, such as relational databases or document databases, to provide a complete and scalable data storage solution.

MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL).

InfluxDB was built from the ground up to be a purpose-built time series database; i.e., it was not repurposed to be time series. Time was built-in from the beginning. InfluxDB is part of a comprehensive platform that supports the collection, storage, monitoring, visualization and alerting of time series data. It’s much more than just a time series database.

NoSQL databases offer data storage and retrieval that is modelled differently to “traditional” relational databases. NoSQL databases typically focus more on horizontal scaling, eventual consistency, speed and flexibility and is used commonly for big data and real-time streaming applications. NoSQL is often described as a BASE system (

A 
wide-column database
 (sometimes referred to as a column database) is similar to a relational database. It store data in tables, rows and columns. However in opposite to relational databases here each row can have its own format of the columns. Column databases can be seen as a two-dimensional key-value database. One of such database system is 
Apache Cassandra
.
Warning:
 
note that a “columnar database” and a “column database” are two different terms!

A real-time database is broadly defined as a data store designed to collect, process, and/or enrich an incoming series of data points (i.e., a data stream) in real time, typically immediately after the data is created.
