A thread is the smallest unit of processing that can be performed in an OS. In most modern operating systems, a thread exists within a process - that is, a single process may contain multiple threads.
Concurrency refers to the execution of multiple threads at the same time. It occurs in an operating system when multiple process threads are executing concurrently. These threads can interact with one another via shared memory or message passing. Concurrency results in resource sharing, which causes issues like deadlocks and resource scarcity. It aids with techniques such as process coordination, memory allocation, and execution schedule to maximize throughput.

POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is a family of standards for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. It describes utilities, APIs, and services that a compliant OS should provide to software, thus making it easier to port programs from one system to another.
A practical example: in a Unix-like operating system, there are three 
standard streams
, 
stdin
, 
stdout
 and 
stderr
 - they are I/O connections that you will probably come across when using a terminal, as they manage the flow from the 
standard input
 (stdin), 
standard output
 (stdout) and 
standard error
 (stderr).
So, in this case, when we want to interact with any of these streams (through a process, for example), the POSIX operating system API makes it easier - for example, in the 
&lt;unistd.h&gt;
 C header where the stdin, stderr, and stdout are defined as 
STDIN_FILENO
, 
STDERR_FILENO
 and 
STDOUT_FILENO
.
POSIX also adds a standard for exit codes, filesystem semantics, and several other command line utility API conventions.

Working within the terminal is common practice for any Backend Developer and there are many commands and utilities that can help you achieve your tasks more efficiently.
The best way to learn these commands is to practice them in your own machine/environment. Specifically, these are related to Linux commands/utilities which are the most prevalent in the market.
To understand these commands, read through the manual pages by using 
man
 command e.g. 
man grep
, 
man awk
 etc.
After enough exposure and practice to these commands, it will become easier to use these in practice

One of the important jobs of an Operating System is to manage various I/O devices including mouse, keyboards, touchpad, disk drives, display adapters, USB devices, Bit-mapped screens, LED, Analog-to-digital converter, On/off switch, network connections, audio I/O, printers, etc.

Operating System is a program that manages a computer’s resources, especially the allocation of those resources among other programs. Typical resources include the central processing unit (CPU), computer memory, file storage, input/output (I/O) devices, and network connections.

The term Memory can be defined as a collection of data in a specific format. It is used to store instructions and process data. The memory comprises a large array or group of words or bytes, each with its own location. The primary motive of a computer system is to execute programs. These programs, along with the information they access, should be in the main memory during execution. The CPU fetches instructions from memory according to the value of the program counter.
To achieve a degree of multiprogramming and proper utilization of memory, memory management is important. There are several memory management methods, reflecting various approaches, and the effectiveness of each algorithm depends on the situation.

Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other. These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies.

Process management involves various tasks like creation, scheduling, termination of processes, and a deadlock. Process is a program that is under execution, which is an important part of modern-day operating systems. The OS must allocate resources that enable processes to share and exchange information. It also protects the resources of each process from other methods and allows synchronization among processes.
