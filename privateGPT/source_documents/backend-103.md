Apart from being used in the browser, JavaScript is also used in backend e.g. using 
Node.js
 or 
Deno
 for writing server-side code in JavaScript.
If you pick up JavaScript for the Backend, my personal recommendation would be to learn 
JavaScript
 and then go with 
Node.js
 as it is the most popular and widely used option. Also, I would recommend learning TypeScript later on as you continue with your backend development Journey; it’s a superset of JavaScript and is used in many projects.

PHP is a general purpose scripting language often used for making dynamic and interactive Web pages. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group and supported by PHP Foundation. PHP supports procedural and object-oriented styles of programming with some elements of functional programming as well.

Even if you’re a beginner the least you would have known is that Web Development is majorly classified into two facets: Frontend Development and Backend Development. And obviously, they both have their respective set of tools and technologies. For instance, when we talk about Frontend Development, there always comes 3 names first and foremost – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
In the same way, when it comes to Backend Web Development – we primarily require a backend (or you can say server-side) programming language to make the website function along with various other tools &amp; technologies such as databases, frameworks, web servers, etc.
Pick a language from the given list and make sure to learn its quirks, core details about its runtime e.g. concurrency, memory model etc.
Java is general-purpose language, primarily used for Internet-based applications. It was created in 1995 by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and is one of the most popular options for backend developers.

Cypress framework is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework built on top of Mocha – a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and convenient. It also uses a BDD/TDD assertion library and a browser to pair with any JavaScript testing framework.

Karate is the only open-source tool to combine API test-automation, mocks, performance-testing and even UI automation into a single, unified framework. The BDD syntax popularized by Cucumber is language-neutral, and easy for even non-programmers. Assertions and HTML reports are built-in, and you can run tests in parallel for speed.
There’s also a cross-platform stand-alone executable for teams not comfortable with Java. You don’t have to compile code. Just write tests in a simple, readable syntax - carefully designed for HTTP, JSON, GraphQL and XML. And you can mix API and UI test-automation within the same test script.
A Java API also exists for those who prefer to programmatically integrate Karate’s rich automation and data-assertion capabilities.

Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs—faster. It is an API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test, and document APIs. With this open-source solution, users can create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests and read their responses.
Newman is a command-line Collection Runner for Postman. It enables you to run and test a Postman Collection directly from the command line. It’s built with extensibility to integrate it with your continuous integration servers and build systems.
