Key terms to know

   Here are some important words and terms to know so you can find your
   way around Bitbucket. Some of these are terms borrowed from Git, others
   are specific to Bitbucket.

Branch

   A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve
   as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of
   them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area,
   and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the
   current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.

Fork

   Instead of using a single server-side repository to act as the
   “central” codebase, forking gives every developer a server-side
   repository. This means that each contributor has not one, but two Git
   repositories: a private local one and a public server-side one.

HEAD

   Git’s way of referring to the current snapshot. Internally, the git
   checkout command simply updates the HEAD to point to either the
   specified branch or commit. When it points to a branch, Git doesn't
   complain, but when you check out a commit, it switches into a “detached
   HEAD” state.

Main

   The default development branch. Whenever you create a git repository, a
   branch named "main" is created, and becomes the active branch.

Pipelines

   [https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines]Bitbucket Pipelines
   is an integrated CI/CD service, built into Bitbucket. It allows you to
   automatically build, test and even deploy your code, based on a
   configuration file in your repository.

Pipes

   [https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/pipes-958765631.html]Bitbuc
   ket Pipes are short code chunks that you can drop into your pipeline to
   perform powerful actions. Pipes make it easier to build powerful,
   automated CI/CD workflows and get up and running quickly.

Project

   A project is a container for repositories. Projects make it easier for
   teams to focus on a goal, product, or process by organizing your
   repositories into projects. Projects can be either visible or hidden
   from public view.

Pull Request

   Pull requests are a feature that makes it easier for developers to
   collaborate using Bitbucket. They provide a user-friendly web interface
   for discussing proposed changes before integrating them into the
   official project.

Working Tree

   The tree of actual checked out files, normally containing the contents
   of the HEAD commit's tree and any local changes you've made but haven't
   yet committed.
