   Programming languages come and go; while some create hype, some just
   vanish away. We all know it is tough to penetrate the developers’ core
   area and influence them, and when it comes to programming languages,
   they are very picky. Well,
   [https://thenewstack.io/the-case-for-rust-as-the-future-of-javascript-i
   nfrastructure/]Rust as a programming language is doing everything it
   can to win the hearts of developers.

   [https://www.rust-lang.org/]Rust has been
   [https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-d
   readed-and-wanted-languages-loved]Stack Overflow’s most loved language
   for four consecutive years in a row, and this indicates that whoever
   has had the opportunity to work with this language fell in love and
   liked it immediately.

   Plus, with popular DevOps tools like
   [https://jfrog.com/artifactory/]JFrog Artifactory now adding support
   for Rust out of the box, it’s exciting to see Rust enter the mainstream
   for many development shops. With this, let’s take a look at why it’s
   gotten so popular.

Introduction to Rust

   Introduced in 2010, Rust was created at Mozilla Research as a more
   reliable, safer alternative to C++. Rust is a static multiparadigm,
   memory-efficient programming language, focused on speed, security, and
   performance. It is used to develop game engines, file systems, websites
   and tools, operating systems, browser components, and much more.
   [https://foundation.rust-lang.org/]Rust Foundation, an independent
   organization, now manages the open source code base.

   Rust supports imperative as well as functional programming, and it is
   also full-featured enough for application development — it is used by
   some of the big giants like DropBox, Coursera, and Firefox, etc. Rust
   also received a lot of attention on HackerNews. Over the last year,
   many big companies like [https://youtu.be/o01QmYVluSw]Microsoft,
   [https://youtu.be/kylqq8pEgRs]Facebook, and
   [https://youtu.be/l9hM0h6IQDo]Intel, joined hands to support Rust.

Why Rust?

   To prove why Rust is phenomenal, let’s talk about some features that
   make Rust shine,
     * Rust has excellent documentation.
     * Rust has a highly user-friendly compiler, including top-notch tools
       such as integrated package managers and multi-editor.
     * Rust tooling has high-level traits such as type inspection and
       auto-completion.
     * Rust is super fast, it prevents crashes, and it is safe by default.
     * Rust resolves obstacles that C and C++ have been struggling with
       for a very long time, and these include memory errors and building
       concurrent programs.

   Companies like Microsoft are
   [https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/11/microsoft-exploring-rust-safety/]us
   ing Rust for the safety of their products. Microsoft is
   [https://thenewstack.io/microsoft-rust-is-the-industrys-best-chance-at-
   safe-systems-programming/]encouraging their developers to rewrite some
   of their components in Rust because they discovered that most of the
   security patches are fixes to memory-related bugs, and Rust would’ve
   been able to catch these bugs during the development phase.

   Microsoft
   [https://medium.com/the-innovation/how-microsoft-is-adopting-rust-e0f88
   16566ba]believes that Rust can help make software bugs, particularly
   those leading to security vulnerabilities, impossible.

What Makes Rust Different?

   Unlike other programming languages,
   [https://research.mozilla.org/rust/]Rust was built from scratch, and it
   incorporates elements and findings from high-level systems programming
   languages and modern programming language design.

   Also, as an open source project, Rust has developers who have optimized
   and smoothed out the user experience. For example, the compiler
   generates very accurate and particularly instructive error messages to
   help the users; it even highlights offending code and also recommends
   how to fix it.

   The Rust community also provides thorough documentation and immediate
   online help. Not just the tooling but infrastructure around Rust is
   commendable. Unlike many other programming languages, where you need to
   use many compilers, Rust can be used with ease by having a single tool,
   named Cargo, to compile the code, run tests, generate documentation,
   and upload a package to a repository and much more.

   Rust has a powerful command-line interface tool; it’s an excellent tool
   for developing web applications and also cross-platform applications.
   Rust is profoundly suitable for low-resource environments. For popular
   development environments, there are Rust plugins, such as Visual Studio
   Code by Microsoft, IntelliJ by JetBrains, and Rust Playground, and it
   provides a rich live online environment of Rust for code
   experimentation.

Some Shining Rust Stats

   When it comes to popularity, Rust is on top. Since 2015, Rust has been
   voted the
   [https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-d
   readed-and-wanted-languages-loved]most loved programming language by
   developers on Stack Overflow’s developer survey for four consecutive
   years (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019):

     * On Google trends, you can see the way Rust’s search results are
       growing year by year:

   According to the
   [https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-d

   020_survey_results/]2020’s Sub-Reddit survey (r/adventofcode), Rust was
   positioned as the second most used programming language after Python.

Let’s Talk about Cargo, the Captain

   Besides being a great and most loved programming language, Rust
   additionally features a build system and a package manager named
   [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html]Cargo. Cargo
   manages many tasks, such as building the code, downloading the
   libraries the code depends on, and building these libraries. The two,
   Rust and Cargo, are bundled together; you get Cargo when you install
   Rust.

   The simple and small programs in Rust will not have any dependencies.
   But as you start writing more complex programs with Rust, there comes a
   need to add and manage dependencies; this is where Cargo comes in
   handy. When you start a project by using Cargo, adding and managing
   dependencies will be much easier things to do. Packages in Rust are
   often referred to as “crates” in the Rust community.

   In simple terms, Rust’s package manager and build system is named
   “Cargo.” Using Cargo, it is effortless and straightforward to access
   libraries provided by the community in crates.io.

   When using Cargo, it will look up and find the accurate version and
   download the source, ensuring that any other required crates are
   downloaded. By following the instructions given on the
   [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install]official website or the
   [https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/getting-started/installation.ht
   ml]Cargo Book, we can easily install both the Rust and the Cargo
   package manager in one go. For Linux/macOS, this should work:

   $ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

   Now we can manage our Rust code by Cargo.

   Cargo is recognized as one of the exceptional strengths of the Rust
   ecosystem. Without Cargo, we would have had to search for libraries,
   download these libraries from unknown sources from GitHub, build as
   static library crates, link them against the program. How painful this
   is all to do. But we have Cargo that does all this for us while working
   with Rust.

   To improve your Rust skills and experiment more, download and read this
   open-source [https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo]Cargo Book written by the
   Rust team.

Real-World Rust Usage and Experiments

   [https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/]Firecracker by
   [https://aws.amazon.com/?utm_content=inline-mention]Amazon Web Services
   is written
   [https://opensource.com/article/19/3/rust-virtual-machine]entirely in
   Rust. It powers Fargate and
   [https://aws.amazon.com/?utm_content=inline-mention]Amazon Web
   Services‘ Lambda.

   Amazon, Google, Intel, and
   [https://www.openshift.com/try?utm_content=inline-mention]Red Hat
   jointly started a project, “[https://github.com/rust-vmm]rust-vmm,” to
   share common Rust “crates” or what we call packages with one another
   and the rest of the Rust community.

   Microsoft used Rust over Go for WebAssembly — a project from Azure to
   test WebAssembly modules in Kubernetes. Apart from this, Microsoft is
   experimenting with Rust to
   [https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-rust-experiments-are-going-we
   ll-but-some-features-are-missing/]rewrite low-level components of
   Windows initially drafted in C and C++.

   Companies like Dropbox, npm, Microsoft, Amazon, Discord, Cloudflare,
   Figma, Coursera, etc [https://serokell.io/blog/rust-companies]use Rust
   in production.

Conclusion

   Rust will probably continue to bloom. As more and more companies choose
   this unique language, it is also time to think about the security
   aspects while creating projects with Rust as the programming language.
   As you look at adopting Rust, you might want to consider managing Cargo
   repositories alongside your current applications. Be sure your artifact
   management tool understands Cargo Crates and provides a secure
   repository.

   language, giving you complete control of your deployment and resolving
   Cargo packages.
