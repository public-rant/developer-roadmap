What is Apache Cassandra Registered ?

Apache Cassandra is an open source NoSQL distributed database trusted by
thousands of companies for scalability and high availability without
compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on
commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for
mission-critical data.

   hybrid

Hybrid

   Masterless architecture and low latency means Cassandra will withstand
   an entire data center outage with no data loss—across public or private
   clouds and on-premises.

   fault

Fault Tolerant

   Cassandra’s support for replicating across multiple datacenters is
   best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the peace of
   mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages. Failed nodes can
   be replaced with no downtime.

   scalable

Focus on Quality

   To ensure reliability and stability, Cassandra is tested on clusters as
   large as 1,000 nodes and with hundreds of real world use cases and
   schemas tested with replay, fuzz, property-based, fault-injection, and
   performance tests.

   performant

Performant

   Cassandra
   [http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol5/p1724_tilmannrabl_vldb2012.pdf]consistently
   outperforms popular NoSQL alternatives in benchmarks and real
   applications, primarily because of fundamental architectural choices.

   control

You’re In Control

   Choose between synchronous or asynchronous replication for each update.
   Highly available asynchronous operations are optimized with features
   like Hinted Handoff and Read Repair.

   cloud native

Security and Observability

   The audit logging feature for operators tracks the DML, DDL, and DCL
   activity with minimal impact to normal workload performance, while the
   fqltool allows the capture and replay of production workloads for
   analysis.

   decentral

Distributed

   Cassandra is suitable for applications that can’t afford to lose data,
   even when an entire data center goes down. There are no single points
   of failure. There are no network bottlenecks. Every node in the cluster
   is identical.

   scalable

Scalable

   Read and write throughput both increase linearly as new machines are
   added, with no downtime or interruption to applications.

   elastic

Elastic

   Cassandra streams data between nodes during scaling operations such as
   adding a new node or datacenter during peak traffic times. Zero Copy
   Streaming makes this up to 5x faster without vnodes for a more elastic
   architecture particularly in cloud and Kubernetes environments.

Cassandra Users

   Cassandra is used by thousands of companies with large active data
   sets.

   "Netflix uses Apache Cassandra heavily to satisfy its ever-growing
   persistence needs on its mission to entertain the world. We have been
   experimenting and partially using the 4.0 beta in our environments and
   its features like Audit Logging and backpressure."

   *– Vinay Chella, Netflix Engineering Manager *

   “Humankind is at a pivotal point in history, that requires us to work
   together to find new innovative ways to process the petabytes of data
   we create every day, and the WitFoo R&D team has found a friend in
   Cassandra through our endeavors to meet big-data needs in cybersecurity
   operations.”

   *– Charles Herring, CTO of WitFoo *

   "Since 2016, application engineers at Bloomberg have turned to
   Cassandra because it’s easy to use, easy to scale, and always
   available. We serve up more than 20 billion requests per day on a
   nearly 1 PB dataset across a fleet of 1,700+ Cassandra nodes."

   – Isaac Reath, Software Engineering Team Lead, NoSQL Infrastructure at
   Bloomberg

   "We needed something that would handle really high write throughput and
   keep scaling on the write throughput. That forced us to look at
   distributed stores, and Apache Cassandra was the option that fitted
   what we needed."

   – Elliott Sims Senior Systems Administrator, Backblaze

Behind the scenes of an Apache Cassandra Release

   Formalizing how we balance the need to evolve and provide cutting-edge
   features with long-term stability. The simple rules we use to decide
   when to merge and why we’ll be supporting three GA releases going
   forward, but why we’ve decided to support four releases for the next
   cycle.

Tightening Security for Apache Cassandra: Part 1

   The growth in ecommerce has demanded a greater focus on data security.
   This is the start of a mini-series by Maulin Vasavada on how to
   customize SSL/TLS configurations to tighten security in Cassandra 4.0+.

Inside Cassandra: an interview with Marcel Birkner at Instana

   A new series that we’ve dubbed "Inside Cassandra" where we interview
   engineers and devs in the community either about their use of Apache
   Cassandra to power their businesses or how they contribute to the
   project. The first installation features an interview with Marcel
   Birkner, Site Reliability Engineer at Instana, and how they use Apache
   Cassandra to store and process metric data at scale and benefit from
   Cassandra’s fault tolerance, and have learned the importance of
   dog-fooding.
