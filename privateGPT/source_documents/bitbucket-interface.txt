   need to get started.

Your work

   The Your work dashboard displays the pull requests and repositories you
   care about.
   Your work
     * On the Your work dashboard you’ll see open pull requests that have
       you as a reviewer, open pull requests you’ve created, and a list of
       repositories you can access.

Repositories

   The Repositories view lists all the repositories you can access.
   Bitbucket projects
     * By default its organized by the Last updated repository, so you’ll
       see the most recently changed repository at the top. Or you can
       search for a repository by name, or filter the list by Project or
       repository Owner.
     * You can also only display the repositories you are watching by
       selecting the Watching filter.

Projects

   Projects allow you to group and organize your repositories to make them
   easier to find. In the Projects view you’ll see existing projects and
   can create a new projects. Clicking on a project displays all the
   repositories in that project.

Pull requests

   Code review is crucial step in the software development life cycle and
   helps ensure you’re shipping quality with confidence. Pull requests are
   where code review happens in Bitbucket, and the Pull requests view
   helps you quickly find what needs your attention.
   Bitbucket pull requests

   Use the quick filter buttons to change which pull requests are listed:
     * Reviewing - Pull requests you’re reviewing
     * Watching - Pull requests you’re watching
     * Mine - Pull requests you created
     * Teams - Pull requests your team created

Issues

   When you add a repository to Bitbucket Cloud, you also get an issue
   tracker. This is the place to track your project's feature requests,
   bug reports, and other tasks.
