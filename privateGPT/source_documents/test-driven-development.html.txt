What is Test Driven Development (TDD)? Example

   By[https://www.guru99.com/author/thomas]Thomas Hamilton UpdatedJune 10,
   2023

What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?

   Test Driven Development (TDD) is software development approach in which
   test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do.
   In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and
   tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in
   order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.

   Test-Driven Development starts with designing and developing tests for
   every small functionality of an application. TDD framework instructs
   developers to write new code only if an automated test has failed. This
   avoids duplication of code. The TDD full form is Test-driven
   development.

   Test Driven Development (TDD): Learn with Example Test Driven
   Development (TDD): Learn with Example

   The simple concept of TDD is to write and correct the failed tests
   before writing new code (before development). This helps to avoid
   duplication of code as we write a small amount of code at a time in
   order to pass tests. (Tests are nothing but requirement conditions that
   we need to test to fulfill them).

   Test-Driven development is a process of developing and running
   automated test before actual development of the application. Hence, TDD
   sometimes also called as Test First Development.

How to perform TDD Test

   Following steps define how to perform TDD test,
    1. Add a test.
    2. Run all tests and see if any new test fails.
    3. Write some code.
    4. Run tests and Refactor code.
    5. Repeat.

   Five Steps of Test-Driven Development

TDD cycle defines

    1. Write a test
    2. Make it run.
    3. Change the code to make it right i.e. Refactor.
    4. Repeat process.

Some clarifications about TDD:

     * TDD approach is neither about “Testing” nor about “Design”.
     * TDD does not mean “write some of the tests, then build a system
       that passes the tests.
     * TDD does not mean “do lots of Testing.”

TDD Vs. Traditional Testing

   Below is the main difference between Test driven development and
   traditional testing:

   TDD approach is primarily a specification technique. It ensures that
   your source code is thoroughly tested at confirmatory level.
     * With traditional testing, a successful test finds one or more
       defects. It is same as TDD. When a test fails, you have made
       progress because you know that you need to resolve the problem.
     * TDD ensures that your system actually meets requirements defined
       for it. It helps to build your confidence about your system.
     * In TDD more focus is on production code that verifies whether
       testing will work properly. In traditional testing, more focus is
       on test case design. Whether the test will show the proper/improper
       execution of the application in order to fulfill requirements.
     * In TDD, you achieve 100% coverage test. Every single line of code
       is tested, unlike traditional testing.
     * The combination of both traditional testing and TDD leads to the
       importance of testing the system rather than perfection of the
       system.
     * In [https://www.guru99.com/agile-scrum-extreme-testing.html]Agile
       Modeling (AM), you should “test with a purpose”. You should know
       why you are testing something and what level its need to be tested.

What is acceptance TDD and Developer TDD

   There are two levels of TDD
    1. Acceptance TDD (ATDD): With ATDD you write a single acceptance
       test. This test fulfills the requirement of the specification or
       satisfies the behavior of the system. After that write just enough
       production/functionality code to fulfill that acceptance test.
       Acceptance test focuses on the overall behavior of the system. ATDD
       also was known as
       [https://www.guru99.com/bdd-testing-rest-api-behave.html]Behavioral
       Driven Development (BDD).
    2. Developer TDD: With Developer TDD you write single developer test
       i.e. unit test and then just enough production code to fulfill that
       test. The unit test focuses on every small functionality of the
       system. Developer TDD is simply called as TDD.The main goal of ATDD
       and TDD is to specify detailed, executable requirements for your
       solution on a just in time (JIT) basis. JIT means taking only those
       requirements in consideration that are needed in the system. So
       increase efficiency.

Scaling TDD via Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD)

   TDD is very good at detailed specification and validation. It fails at
   thinking through bigger issues such as overall design, use of the
   system, or UI. AMDD addresses the Agile scaling issues that TDD does
   not.

   Thus AMDD used for bigger issues.

The lifecycle of AMDD

   Test Driven Development (TDD): Learn with Example Test Driven
   Development (TDD): Learn with Example

   In Model-driven Development (MDD), extensive models are created before
   the source code is written. Which in turn have an agile approach?

   In above figure, each box represents a development activity.

   Envisioning is one of the TDD process of predicting/imagining tests
   which will be performed during the first week of the project. The main
   goal of envisioning is to identify the scope of the system and
   architecture of the system. High-level requirements and architecture
   modeling is done for successful envisioning.

   It is the process where not a detailed specification of software/system
   is done but exploring the requirements of software/system which defines
   the overall strategy of the project.

Iteration 0: Envisioning

   There are two main sub-activates.
    1. Initial requirements envisioning.It may take several days to
       identify high-level requirements and scope of the system. The main
       focus is to explore usage model, Initial domain model, and user
       interface model (UI).
    2. Initial Architectural envisioning. It also takes several days to
       identify architecture of the system. It allows setting technical
       directions for the project. The main focus is to explore technology
       diagrams, User Interface (UI) flow, domain models, and Change
       cases.

Iteration modeling

   Here team must plan the work that will be done for each iteration.
     * Agile process is used for each iteration, i.e. during each
       iteration, new work item will be added with priority.
     * First higher prioritized work will be taken into consideration.
       Work items added may be reprioritized or removed from items stack
       any time.
     * The team discusses how they are going to implement each
       requirement. Modeling is used for this purpose.
     * Modeling analysis and design is done for each requirement which is
       going to implement for that iteration.

Model storming

   This is also known as Just in time Modeling.
     * Here modeling session involves a team of 2/3 members who discuss
       issues on paper or whiteboard.
     * One team member will ask another to model with them. This modeling
       session will take approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Where team members
       gather together to share whiteboard/paper.
     * They explore issues until they don’t find the main cause of the
       problem. Just in time, if one team member identifies the issue
       which he/she wants to resolve then he/she will take quick help of
       other team members.
     * Other group members then explore the issue and then everyone
       continues on as before. It is also called as stand-up modeling or
       customer QA sessions.

Test Driven Development (TDD)

     * It promotes confirmatory testing of your application code and
       detailed specification.
     * Both acceptance test (detailed requirements) and developer tests
       (unit test) are inputs for TDD.
     * TDD makes the code simpler and clear. It allows the developer to
       maintain less documentation.

Reviews

     * This is optional. It includes code inspections and model reviews.
     * This can be done for each iteration or for the whole project.
     * This is a good option to give feedback for the project.

Test Driven Development (TDD) Vs. Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD)

   TDD AMDD
   TDD shortens the programming feedback loop AMDD shortens modeling
   feedback loop.
   TDD is detailed specification AMDD works for bigger issues
   TDD promotes the development of high-quality code AMDD promotes
   high-quality communication with stakeholders and developers.
   TDD speaks to programmers AMDD talks to

   Analyst, stakeholders, and data professionals.
   TDD non-visually oriented AMDD visually oriented
   TDD has limited scope to software works AMDD has a broad scope
   including stakeholders. It involves working towards a common
   understanding
   Both support evolutionary development ——————————————–

TDD Frameworks

   Here is the list of best test driven development (TDD) frameworks
    1. [https://www.guru99.com/junit-tutorial.html]Junit
    2. [https://www.guru99.com/all-about-testng-and-selenium.html]TestNG
    3. csUnit and NUnit
    4. Rspec

   Now, let’s learn Test Driven Development by example.

Example of TDD

   Here in this Test Driven Development example, we will define a class
   password. For this class, we will try to satisfy following conditions.

   A condition for Password acceptance:
     * The password should be between 5 to 10 characters.

   First in this TDD example, we write the code that fulfills all the
   above requirements.

   Test Driven Development (TDD): Learn with Example Test Driven
   Development (TDD): Learn with Example

   Scenario 1: To run the test, we create class PasswordValidator ();

   Test Driven Development (TDD): Learn with Example Test Driven
   Development (TDD): Learn with Example

   We will run above class TestPassword ();

   Output is PASSED as shown below;

   Output:

   Test Driven Development (TDD): Learn with Example Test Driven
   Development (TDD): Learn with Example

   Scenario 2: Here we can see in method TestPasswordLength () there is no
   need of creating an instance of class PasswordValidator. Instance means
   creating an [https://www.guru99.com/java-oops-class-objects.html]object
   of class to refer the members (variables/methods) of that class.

   Test Driven Development (TDD): Learn with Example Test Driven
   Development (TDD): Learn with Example

   We will remove class PasswordValidator pv = new PasswordValidator ()
   from the code. We can call the isValid () method directly by
   PasswordValidator. IsValid (“Abc123”). (See image below)

   So we Refactor (change code) as below:

   Test Driven Development (TDD): Learn with Example Test Driven
   Development (TDD): Learn with Example

   Scenario 3: After refactoring the output shows failed status (see image
   below) this is because we have removed the instance. So there is no
   reference to
   [https://www.guru99.com/java-static-variable-methods.html]non –static
   method isValid ().

   Test Driven Development (TDD): Learn with Example Test Driven
   Development (TDD): Learn with Example

   So we need to change this method by adding “static” word before Boolean
   as public static boolean isValid (String password). Refactoring Class
   PasswordValidator () to remove above error to pass the test.

   Test Driven Development (TDD): Learn with Example Test Driven
   Development (TDD): Learn with Example

   Output:

   After making changes to class PassValidator () if we run the test then
   the output will be PASSED as shown below.

Advantages of TDD

   Following are the main advantages of Test Driven Development in
   Software Engineering:

Early bug notification.

     * Developers test their code but in the database world, this often
       consists of manual tests or one-off scripts. Using TDD you build
       up, over time, a suite of automated tests that you and any other
       developer can rerun at will.

Better Designed, cleaner and more extensible code.

     * It helps to understand how the code will be used and how it
       interacts with other modules.
     * It results in better design decision and more maintainable code.
     * TDD allows writing smaller code having single responsibility rather
       than monolithic procedures with multiple responsibilities. This
       makes the code simpler to understand.
     * TDD also forces to write only production code to pass tests based
       on user requirements.

Confidence to Refactor

     * If you refactor code, there can be possibilities of breaks in the
       code. So having a set of automated tests you can fix those breaks
       before release. Proper warning will be given if breaks found when
       automated tests are used.
     * Using TDD, should results in faster, more extensible code with
       fewer bugs that can be updated with minimal risks.

Good for teamwork

     * In the absence of any team member, other team members can easily
       pick up and work on the code. It also aids knowledge sharing,
       thereby making the team more effective overall.

Good for Developers

     * Though developers have to spend more time in writing TDD test
       cases, it takes a lot less time for debugging and developing new
       features. You will write cleaner, less complicated code.

Summary:

     * TDD stands for Test-driven development.
     * TDD meaning: It is a process of modifying the code in order to pass
       a test designed previously.
     * It more emphasis on production code rather than test case design.
     * Test-driven development is a process of modifying the code in order
       to pass a test designed previously.
     * In Software Engineering, It is sometimes known as “Test First
       Development.”
     * TDD testing includes refactoring a code i.e. changing/adding some
       amount of code to the existing code without affecting the behavior
       of the code.
     * TDD programming when used, the code becomes clearer and simple to
       understand.
