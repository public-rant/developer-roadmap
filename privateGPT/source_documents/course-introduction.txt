roduction#a-comprehensive-course-on-mysql-for-developers]A comprehensive
course on MySQL for developers

   Welcome to the MySQL for Developers course, where we’ll cover
   everything you need to know to become an expert user of the MySQL
   database. My name is Aaron Francis, and I’ll be your instructor for the
   course. We’ll be breaking the course down into several sections,
   starting with the schema and covering everything from data types to
   indexes, to querying, and much more.

[https://planetscale.com/courses/mysql-for-developers/introduction/course-int
roduction#schema-what-makes-an-effective-and-efficient-table]Schema: what
makes an effective and efficient table?

   In the first section of the course, we’re going to start by looking at
   schema basics. What makes an effective table? How do different data
   types in MySQL work? When should you use one type over another? We’ll
   also look at the drawbacks of certain data types and how to avoid them
   while building a schema. This is the foundation for the rest of the
   course, so make sure you understand these concepts before moving on to
   more advanced topics.

[https://planetscale.com/courses/mysql-for-developers/introduction/course-int
roduction#indexing-what-is-an-index-and-how-it-works]Indexing: what is an
index and how it works?

   In the next section of the course, we’ll cover indexing in depth. What
   is an index, and why is it so fast? How can we make the most of it when
   building our schema? We’ll cover all of these questions and more in
   this section.

[https://planetscale.com/courses/mysql-for-developers/introduction/course-int
roduction#querying-writing-efficient-and-effective-queries]Querying: writing
efficient and effective queries

   In the third section of the course, we’ll cover querying. How do we
   write efficient and effective queries? How do we use the indexes we
   built earlier to make our queries super fast? This section builds on
   everything we’ve covered in the previous sections, so make sure you
   have a strong foundation before attempting it.

[https://planetscale.com/courses/mysql-for-developers/introduction/course-int
roduction#putting-it-all-together-examples-for-application-developers]Putting
it all together: examples for application developers

   In the final section of the course, we’ll take everything we’ve learned
   and put it together into a series of examples that application
   developers often encounter. By the end of this section, you’ll have a
   deep understanding of how to build efficient and effective MySQL
   databases that work well for your applications.

[https://planetscale.com/courses/mysql-for-developers/introduction/course-int
roduction#who-this-is-for]Who this is for

   This course is designed specifically for developers, so no prior
   knowledge of databases is required. We won’t be covering low-level
   details or administration, as this course is focused on how to use
   MySQL effectively as an application developer. If you’ve found
   databases intimidating in the past, don’t worry—we’ll take it step by
   step, and you’ll be an expert user by the end of the course.

[https://planetscale.com/courses/mysql-for-developers/introduction/course-int
roduction#screen-overview]Screen overview

   Throughout the course, we’ll be using a TablePlus client on my Mac to
   run queries and view results. You’ll see me on screen sometimes, and
   most of the time, I’ll be up in the corner while we look at the
   TablePlus client. We won’t be using a lot of slides, as I know they can
   be boring. Instead, we’ll be getting hands-on and looking at actual
   tables, queries, indexes, and more within the TablePlus client.

roduction#conclusion]Conclusion

   This course covers everything you need to know to become an expert user
   of MySQL as a developer. We’ll start with the basics of schema and data
   types, move on to indexing and querying, and finish up with real-world
   examples. By the end of the course, you’ll have a deep understanding of
   how to build efficient and effective MySQL databases that work well for
   your applications. I hope you enjoy the course and learn a lot!
