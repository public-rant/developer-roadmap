   Token-based authentication is a protocol which allows users to verify
   their identity, and in return receive a unique
   [https://www.okta.com/identity-101/access-token/]access token. During
   the life of the token, users then access the website or app that the
   token has been issued for, rather than having to re-enter credentials
   each time they go back to the same webpage, app, or any resource
   protected with that same token.

   Auth tokens work like a stamped ticket. The user retains access as long
   as the token remains valid. Once the user logs out or quits an app, the
   token is invalidated.

   Token-based authentication is different from traditional password-based
   or server-based authentication techniques. Tokens offer a second layer
   of security, and administrators have detailed control over each action
   and transaction.

   But using tokens requires a bit of coding know-how. Most developers
   pick up the techniques quickly, but there is a learning curve.

   Let's dig in, so you can determine if tokens are right for you and your
   organization.

A History of Authentication Tokens

   [https://www.okta.com/identity-101/authentication-vs-authorization/]Aut
   hentication and authorization are different but related concepts.
   Before we had authentication tokens, we had passwords and servers. We
   used traditional methods to ensure that the right people had access to
   the right things at the right time. It wasn't always effective.

   Consider passwords. Typically, they involve:
     * User generation. Someone comes up with a combination of letters,
       numbers, and symbols.
     * Memory. The person must keep that unique combination in their mind.
     * Repetition. Whenever the user needs to access something, the
       password has to be entered.

   Password theft is common. In fact, one of the first documented cases of
   password theft happened all the way
   [https://www.wired.com/2012/01/computer-password/]back in 1962. People
   can't remember all of their passwords, so they resort to tricks, such
   as:
     * Writing them all down. Loose pieces of paper filled with passwords
       are security nightmares.
     * Repeating them. People tend to use the same password in multiple
       places. If one password is discovered, many accounts may be
       vulnerable.
     * Slightly changing them. People change one letter or number when
       prompted to update a password.

   Passwords also require server authentication. Each time the person logs
   on, the computer creates a record of the transaction. Memory load
   increases accordingly.

   Token authentication is different.

   With token authentication, a secondary service verifies a server
   request. When verification is complete, the server issues a token and
   responds to the request.

   The user may still have one password to remember, but the token offers
   another form of access that's much harder to steal or overcome. And the
   session's record takes up no space on the server.

3 Authentication Token Types

   All [https://www.okta.com/identity-101/security-token/]authentication
   tokens allow access, but each type works a little differently.

   These are three common types of authentication tokens:
     * Connected: Keys, discs, drives, and other physical items plug into
       the system for access. If you've ever used a USB device or
       smartcard to log into a system, you've used a connected token.
     * Contactless: A device is close enough to a server to communicate
       with it, but it doesn't plug in. Microsoft's so-called
       "[https://smallbiztrends.com/2017/07/token-ring-will-replace-passwo
       rds.html]magic ring" would be an example of this type of token.
     * Disconnected: A device can communicate with the server across long
       distances, even if it never touches another device at all. If
       you've ever used your phone for a two-factor authentication
       process, you've used this type of token.

   In all three of these scenarios, a user must do something to start the
   process. They may need to enter a password or answer a question. But
   even when they complete those preliminary steps perfectly, they can't
   gain access without the help of an access token.

Token Authentication in 4 Easy Steps

   Use a token-based authentication system, and visitors will verify
   credentials just once. In return, they'll get a token that allows
   access for a time period you define.

   The process works like this:
     * Request: The person asks for access to a server or protected
       resource. That could involve a login with a password, or it could
       involve some other process you specify.
     * Verification: The server determines that the person should have
       access. That could involve checking the password against the
       username, or it could involve another process you specify.
     * Tokens: The server communicates with the authentication device,
       like a ring, key, phone, or similar device. After verification, the
       server issues a token and passes it to the user.
     * Storage: The token sits within the user's browser while work
       continues.

   If the user attempts to visit a different part of the server, the token
   communicates with the server again. Access is granted or denied based
   on the token.

   Administrators set limits on tokens. You could allow a one-use token
   that is immediately destroyed when the person logs out. Or you could
   set the token to self-destruct at the end of a specified time period.
   Token Based Authentication

JSON Web Token (JWT): A Special Form of Auth Token

   Because so many users are accessing systems via mobile phones (apps)
   and web apps nowadays, developers need a secure way to authenticate
   thatâ€™s appropriate for those platforms.

   To solve that challenge, many developers turn to JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
   when working on tokens for their applications.

   A JSON web token (JWT) is an [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519]open
   standard. The finished product allows for safe, secure communication
   between two parties. Data is verified with a digital signature, and if
   it's sent via HTTP, encryption keeps the data secure.

   JWTs have three important components.
    1. Header: Define token type and the signing algorithm involved in
       this space.
    2. Payload: Define the token issuer, the expiration of the token, and
       more in this section.
    3. Signature: Verify that the message hasn't changed in transit with a
       secure signature.

   Coding ties these pieces together. The finished product looks something
   like this.

   Don't be intimidated by
   [https://www.okta.com/video/oktane20-whats-new-with-oauth-and-oidc/]JSO
   N code. This type of notation is common when entities want to pass data
   back and forth, and tutorials abound. If you're interested in using
   JSON tokens but you've never tried the language before, a
   [https://jwt.io/introduction/]resource like this could be helpful.

Pros & Cons of JWTs

   There are many benefits of JWTs.
     * Size: Tokens in this code language are tiny, and they can be passed
       between two entities quite quickly.
     * Ease: Tokens can be generated from almost anywhere, and they don't
       need to be verified on your server.
     * Control: You can specify what someone can access, how long that
       permission lasts, and what the person can do while logged on.

   There are also potential disadvantages.
     * Single key: JWTs rely on a single key. If that key is compromised,
       the entire system is at risk.
     * Complexity: These tokens arenâ€™t simple to understand. If a
       developer doesnâ€™t have a strong knowledge of cryptographic
       signature algorithms, they could inadvertently put the system at
       risk.
     * Limitations: You canâ€™t push messages to all clients, and you canâ€™t
       manage clients from the server side.

Why Should You Try Authorization Tokens?

   You've assessed your current strategy, and you think things are working
   just fine. Why should authorization tokens become part of your systems?
   Very real benefits come to developers who take the plunge.

   Authorization tokens are good for administrators of systems that:
     * Often grant temporary access. Your user base fluctuates based on
       the date, the time, or a special event. Granting and rescinding
       access repeatedly is too draining. Tokens could be helpful.
       Administrators of university library sites, for example, might
       appreciate a token approach.
     * Require granular access. Your server grants access based on
       specific document properties, not user properties. Passwords don't
       allow that time of fine-tuned detail.
       For example, you run an online journal. You want everyone to read
       and comment on only one document, not on any others. Tokens could
       allow this.
     * Are prime hacking targets. Your server contains sensitive documents
       that could do your company intense damage on release. A simple
       password doesn't offer enough protection. A piece of hardware helps
       quite a bit.

   Many more authentication token use cases exist. But this quick list
   could get your creative juices flowing, and the more you think about
   the benefits, the more likely you might be to get on board.

Follow Authentication Token Best Practices

   Authentication tokens are meant to enhance your security protocols and
   keep your server safe. But they won't work effectively if you don't
   build your processes with safety in mind.

   Your authentication tokens should be:
     * Private. Users can't share token authentication devices or pass
       them around between departments. Just as they wouldn't share
       passwords, they shouldn't share any other part of your security
       system.
     * Secure. Communication between the token and your server must be
       secure via HHTPS connections. Encryption is a critical part of
       keeping tokens safe.
     * Tested. Run periodic token tests to ensure that your system is
       secure and functioning properly. If you spot a problem, fix it
       quickly.
     * Appropriate. Pick the right token type for your individual use
       case. For example, JWTs aren't ideal for session tokens. They can
       be costly, and security risks involved with interception are
       impossible to eliminate. Ensure you're always picking the right
       tool for the job.

   Don't take your authentication token decision lightly. Do your
   homework, ask your peers, and ensure that you're doing the best job you
   can for your company.
