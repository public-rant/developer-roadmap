An overview of HTTP

   HTTP is a
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol]protocol
   for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of
   any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which
   means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.
   A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents
   fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos,
   scripts, and more.

   A Web document is the composition of different resources

   Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as
   opposed to a stream of data). The messages sent by the client, usually
   a Web browser, are called requests and the messages sent by the server
   as an answer are called responses.

   HTTP as an application layer protocol, on top of TCP (transport layer)
   and IP (network layer) and below the presentation layer. Designed in
   the early 1990s, HTTP is an extensible protocol which has evolved over
   time. It is an application layer protocol that is sent over
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP]TCP, or over a
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS]TLS-encrypted
   TCP connection, though any reliable transport protocol could
   theoretically be used. Due to its extensibility, it is used to not only
   fetch hypertext documents, but also images and videos or to post
   content to servers, like with HTML form results. HTTP can also be used
   to fetch parts of documents to update Web pages on demand.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#components_of_htt
p-based_systems]Components of HTTP-based systems

   HTTP is a client-server protocol: requests are sent by one entity, the
   user-agent (or a proxy on behalf of it). Most of the time the
   user-agent is a Web browser, but it can be anything, for example, a
   robot that crawls the Web to populate and maintain a search engine
   index.

   Each individual request is sent to a server, which handles it and
   provides an answer called the response. Between the client and the
   server there are numerous entities, collectively called
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Proxy_server]proxies
   , which perform different operations and act as gateways or
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cache]caches, for
   example.

   Client server chain

   In reality, there are more computers between a browser and the server
   handling the request: there are routers, modems, and more. Thanks to
   the layered design of the Web, these are hidden in the network and
   transport layers. HTTP is on top, at the application layer. Although
   important for diagnosing network problems, the underlying layers are
   mostly irrelevant to the description of HTTP.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#client_the_user-a
gent]Client: the user-agent

   The user-agent is any tool that acts on behalf of the user. This role
   is primarily performed by the Web browser, but it may also be performed
   by programs used by engineers and Web developers to debug their
   applications.

   The browser is always the entity initiating the request. It is never
   the server (though some mechanisms have been added over the years to
   simulate server-initiated messages).

   To display a Web page, the browser sends an original request to fetch
   the HTML document that represents the page. It then parses this file,
   making additional requests corresponding to execution scripts, layout
   information (CSS) to display, and sub-resources contained within the
   page (usually images and videos). The Web browser then combines these
   resources to present the complete document, the Web page. Scripts
   executed by the browser can fetch more resources in later phases and
   the browser updates the Web page accordingly.

   A Web page is a hypertext document. This means some parts of the
   displayed content are links, which can be activated (usually by a click
   of the mouse) to fetch a new Web page, allowing the user to direct
   their user-agent and navigate through the Web. The browser translates
   these directions into HTTP requests, and further interprets the HTTP
   responses to present the user with a clear response.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#the_web_server]Th
e Web server

   On the opposite side of the communication channel is the server, which
   serves the document as requested by the client. A server appears as
   only a single machine virtually; but it may actually be a collection of
   servers sharing the load (load balancing), or other software (such as
   caches, a database server, or e-commerce servers), totally or partially
   generating the document on demand.

   A server is not necessarily a single machine, but several server
   software instances can be hosted on the same machine. With HTTP/1.1 and
   the
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Host]Host
   header, they may even share the same IP address.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#proxies]Proxies

   Between the Web browser and the server, numerous computers and machines
   relay the HTTP messages. Due to the layered structure of the Web stack,
   most of these operate at the transport, network or physical levels,
   becoming transparent at the HTTP layer and potentially having a
   significant impact on performance. Those operating at the application
   layers are generally called proxies. These can be transparent,
   forwarding on the requests they receive without altering them in any
   way, or non-transparent, in which case they will change the request in
   some way before passing it along to the server. Proxies may perform
   numerous functions:
     * caching (the cache can be public or private, like the browser
       cache)
     * filtering (like an antivirus scan or parental controls)
     * load balancing (to allow multiple servers to serve different
       requests)
     * authentication (to control access to different resources)
     * logging (allowing the storage of historical information)

http]Basic aspects of HTTP

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#http_is_simple]HT
TP is simple

   HTTP is generally designed to be simple and human-readable, even with
   the added complexity introduced in HTTP/2 by encapsulating HTTP
   messages into frames. HTTP messages can be read and understood by
   humans, providing easier testing for developers, and reduced complexity
   for newcomers.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#http_is_extensibl
e]HTTP is extensible

   Introduced in HTTP/1.0,
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers]HTTP headers
   make this protocol easy to extend and experiment with. New
   functionality can even be introduced by a simple agreement between a
   client and a server about a new header's semantics.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#http_is_stateless
_but_not_sessionless]HTTP is stateless, but not sessionless

   HTTP is stateless: there is no link between two requests being
   successively carried out on the same connection. This immediately has
   the prospect of being problematic for users attempting to interact with
   certain pages coherently, for example, using e-commerce shopping
   baskets. But while the core of HTTP itself is stateless, HTTP cookies
   allow the use of stateful sessions. Using header extensibility, HTTP
   Cookies are added to the workflow, allowing session creation on each
   HTTP request to share the same context, or the same state.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#http_and_connecti
ons]HTTP and connections

   A connection is controlled at the transport layer, and therefore
   fundamentally out of scope for HTTP. HTTP doesn't require the
   underlying transport protocol to be connection-based; it only requires
   it to be reliable, or not lose messages (at minimum, presenting an
   error in such cases). Among the two most common transport protocols on
   the Internet, TCP is reliable and UDP isn't. HTTP therefore relies on
   the TCP standard, which is connection-based.

   Before a client and server can exchange an HTTP request/response pair,
   they must establish a TCP connection, a process which requires several
   round-trips. The default behavior of HTTP/1.0 is to open a separate TCP
   connection for each HTTP request/response pair. This is less efficient
   than sharing a single TCP connection when multiple requests are sent in
   close succession.

   In order to mitigate this flaw, HTTP/1.1 introduced pipelining (which
   proved difficult to implement) and persistent connections: the
   underlying TCP connection can be partially controlled using the
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Connection]C
   onnection header. HTTP/2 went a step further by multiplexing messages
   over a single connection, helping keep the connection warm and more
   efficient.

   Experiments are in progress to design a better transport protocol more
   suited to HTTP. For example, Google is experimenting with
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC]QUIC which builds on UDP to provide
   a more reliable and efficient transport protocol.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#what_can_be_contr
olled_by_http]What can be controlled by HTTP

   This extensible nature of HTTP has, over time, allowed for more control
   and functionality of the Web. Cache and authentication methods were
   functions handled early in HTTP history. The ability to relax the
   origin constraint, by contrast, was only added in the 2010s.

   Here is a list of common features controllable with HTTP:
     * [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching]Caching:
       How documents are cached can be controlled by HTTP. The server can
       instruct proxies and clients about what to cache and for how long.
       The client can instruct intermediate cache proxies to ignore the
       stored document.
     * Relaxing the origin constraint: To prevent snooping and other
       privacy invasions, Web browsers enforce strict separation between
       websites. Only pages from the same origin can access all the
       information of a Web page. Though such a constraint is a burden to
       the server, HTTP headers can relax this strict separation on the
       server side, allowing a document to become a patchwork of
       information sourced from different domains; there could even be
       security-related reasons to do so.
     * Authentication: Some pages may be protected so that only specific
       users can access them. Basic authentication may be provided by
       HTTP, either using the
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/WWW-Auth
       enticate]WWW-Authenticate and similar headers, or by setting a
       specific session using
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies]HTTP
       cookies.
     * [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Proxy_servers_an
       d_tunneling]Proxy and tunneling: Servers or clients are often
       located on intranets and hide their true IP address from other
       computers. HTTP requests then go through proxies to cross this
       network barrier. Not all proxies are HTTP proxies. The SOCKS
       protocol, for example, operates at a lower level. Other protocols,
       like ftp, can be handled by these proxies.
     * Sessions: Using HTTP cookies allows you to link requests with the
       state of the server. This creates sessions, despite basic HTTP
       being a state-less protocol. This is useful not only for e-commerce
       shopping baskets, but also for any site allowing user configuration
       of the output.

   When a client wants to communicate with a server, either the final
   server or an intermediate proxy, it performs the following steps:
    1. Open a TCP connection: The TCP connection is used to send a
       request, or several, and receive an answer. The client may open a
       new connection, reuse an existing connection, or open several TCP
       connections to the servers.
    2. Send an HTTP message: HTTP messages (before HTTP/2) are
       human-readable. With HTTP/2, these simple messages are encapsulated
       in frames, making them impossible to read directly, but the
       principle remains the same. For example:
       http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: developer.mozilla.org
Accept-Language: fr

    3. Read the response sent by the server, such as:
       http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 09 Oct 2010 14:28:02 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Tue, 01 Dec 2009 20:18:22 GMT
ETag: "51142bc1-7449-479b075b2891b"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 29769
Content-Type: text/html

<!DOCTYPE html>… (here come the 29769 bytes of the requested web page)

    4. Close or reuse the connection for further requests.

   If HTTP pipelining is activated, several requests can be sent without
   waiting for the first response to be fully received. HTTP pipelining
   has proven difficult to implement in existing networks, where old
   pieces of software coexist with modern versions. HTTP pipelining has
   been superseded in HTTP/2 with more robust multiplexing requests within
   a frame.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#http_messages]HTT
P Messages

   HTTP messages, as defined in HTTP/1.1 and earlier, are human-readable.
   In HTTP/2, these messages are embedded into a binary structure, a
   frame, allowing optimizations like compression of headers and
   multiplexing. Even if only part of the original HTTP message is sent in
   this version of HTTP, the semantics of each message is unchanged and
   the client reconstitutes (virtually) the original HTTP/1.1 request. It
   is therefore useful to comprehend HTTP/2 messages in the HTTP/1.1
   format.

   There are two types of HTTP messages, requests and responses, each with
   its own format.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#requests]Requests

   An example HTTP request:

   A basic HTTP request

   Requests consist of the following elements:
     * An HTTP
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods]method,
       usually a verb like
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET]GET,
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST]POS
       T, or a noun like
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/OPTIONS]
       OPTIONS or
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/HEAD]HEA
       D that defines the operation the client wants to perform.
       Typically, a client wants to fetch a resource (using GET) or post
       the value of an
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms]HTML form
       (using POST), though more operations may be needed in other cases.
     * The path of the resource to fetch; the URL of the resource stripped
       from elements that are obvious from the context, for example
       without the
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol]protoco
       l (http://), the
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Domain]domain
       (here, developer.mozilla.org), or the TCP
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Port]port (here,
       80).
     * The version of the HTTP protocol.
     * Optional
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers]headers
       that convey additional information for the servers.
     * A body, for some methods like POST, similar to those in responses,
       which contain the resource sent.

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#responses]Respons
es

   An example response:

   HTTP Response image

   Responses consist of the following elements:
     * The version of the HTTP protocol they follow.
     * A [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status]status
       code, indicating if the request was successful or not, and why.
     * A status message, a non-authoritative short description of the
       status code.
     * HTTP
       [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers]headers,
       like those for requests.
     * Optionally, a body containing the fetched resource.

p]APIs based on HTTP

   The most commonly used API based on HTTP is the
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest]XMLHtt
   pRequest API, which can be used to exchange data between a
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent]user
   agent and a server. The modern
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API]Fetch API
   provides the same features with a more powerful and flexible feature
   set.

   Another API,
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events]se
   rver-sent events, is a one-way service that allows a server to send
   events to the client, using HTTP as a transport mechanism. Using the
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource]EventSour
   ce interface, the client opens a connection and establishes event
   handlers. The client browser automatically converts the messages that
   arrive on the HTTP stream into appropriate
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event]Event objects.
   Then it delivers them to the event handlers that have been registered
   for the events'
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/type]type if
   known, or to the
   [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource/message_e
   vent]onmessage event handler if no type-specific event handler was
   established.

sion

   HTTP is an extensible protocol that is easy to use. The client-server
   structure, combined with the ability to add headers, allows HTTP to
   advance along with the extended capabilities of the Web.

   Though HTTP/2 adds some complexity by embedding HTTP messages in frames
   to improve performance, the basic structure of messages has stayed the
   same since HTTP/1.0. Session flow remains simple, allowing it to be
   investigated and debugged with a simple
