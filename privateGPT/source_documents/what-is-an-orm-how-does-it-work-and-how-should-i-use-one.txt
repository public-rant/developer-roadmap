       I found this question but it's from 2009 and I don't know if you
       already master ORM but look for Entity Framework in CodePlex
       C#([http://entityframework.codeplex.com/]entityframework.codeplex.c
       om) Here is the source code which you can learn from. Also you can
       read this.

       This is a useful question and the votes for the top answer seem to
       confirm that. A brief description of what ORM is does not require
       opinion. Just because the user asks for a link to get started the
       question is flagged off-topic. I feel that this is a frequent
       over-reaction from moderators.

       could be useful info in the answers, but that does not make the

       @NeilG The issue is that the question includes a request for
       resources (both in the title and in the question). Such requests
       are off-topic, largely because it results in people just posting a
       link to their favorite resource, as has happened in several of the
       answers here. Removing the request for resources from the question
       would invalidate some existing answers. As regular users, we are
       not permitted to edit the question to invalidate answers. Thus, it
       should be closed. If the question was unanswered, then it could be
       edited to remove those requests and left open.

Introduction

   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping]Object-Relatio
   nal Mapping (ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate
   data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. When talking
   about ORM, most people are referring to a library that implements the
   Object-Relational Mapping technique, hence the phrase "an ORM".

   An ORM library is a completely ordinary library written in your
   language of choice that encapsulates the code needed to manipulate the
   data, so you don't use SQL anymore; you interact directly with an
   object in the same language you're using.

   For example, here is a completely imaginary case with a pseudo
   language:

   You have a book class, you want to retrieve all the books of which the
   author is "Linus". Manually, you would do something like that:
book_list = new List();
sql = "SELECT book FROM library WHERE author = 'Linus'";
data = query(sql); // I over simplify ...
while (row = data.next())
{
     book = new Book();
     book.setAuthor(row.get('author');
     book_list.add(book);
}

   With an ORM library, it would look like this:
book_list = BookTable.query(author="Linus");

   The mechanical part is taken care of automatically via the ORM library.

Pros and Cons

   Using ORM saves a lot of time because:
     * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself]DRY: You
       write your data model in only one place, and it's easier to update,
       maintain, and reuse the code.
     * A lot of stuff is done automatically, from database handling to
       [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localizatio
       n]I18N.
     * It forces you to write
       [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controlle
       r]MVC code, which, in the end, makes your code a little cleaner.
     * You don't have to write poorly-formed SQL (most Web programmers
       really suck at it, because SQL is treated like a "sub" language,
       when in reality it's a very powerful and complex one).
     * Sanitizing; using prepared statements or transactions are as easy
       as calling a method.

   Using an ORM library is more flexible because:
     * It fits in your natural way of coding (it's your language!).
     * It abstracts the DB system, so you can change it whenever you want.
     * The model is weakly bound to the rest of the application, so you
       can change it or use it anywhere else.
     * It lets you use OOP goodness like data inheritance without a
       headache.

   But ORM can be a pain:
     * You have to learn it, and ORM libraries are not lightweight tools;
     * You have to set it up. Same problem.
     * Performance is OK for usual queries, but a SQL master will always
       do better with his own SQL for big projects.
     * It abstracts the DB. While it's OK if you know what's happening
       behind the scene, it's a trap for new programmers that can write
       very greedy statements, like a heavy hit in a for loop.

How to learn about ORM?

   Well, use one. Whichever ORM library you choose, they all use the same
   principles. There are a lot of ORM libraries around here:
     * Java: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernate_(Java)]Hibernate.
     * PHP: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propel_(PHP)]Propel or
       [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine_(PHP)]Doctrine (I prefer
       the last one).
     * Python: the Django ORM or
       [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLAlchemy]SQLAlchemy (My favorite
       ORM library ever).
     * C#: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHibernate]NHibernate or
       [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_Framework]Entity Framework

   If you want to try an ORM library in Web programming, you'd be better
   off using an entire framework stack like:
     * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symfony]Symfony (PHP, using Propel
       or Doctrine).
     * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)]Django
       (Python, using a internal ORM).

   Do not try to write your own ORM, unless you are trying to learn
   something. This is a gigantic piece of work, and the old ones took a
   lot of time and work before they became reliable.

   ORM stands for "Object to Relational Mapping" where
     * The Object part is the one you use with your programming language (
       python in this case )
     * The Relational part is a Relational Database Manager System ( A
       database that is ) there are other types of databases but the most
       popular is relational ( you know tables, columns, pk fk etc eg
       Oracle MySQL, MS-SQL )
     * And finally the Mapping part is where you do a bridge between your
       objects and your tables.

   In applications where you don't use a ORM framework you do this by
   hand. Using an ORM framework would allow you do reduce the boilerplate
   needed to create the solution.

   So let's say you have this object.
 class Employee:
      def __init__( self, name ):
          self.__name = name

       def getName( self ):
           return self.__name

       #etc.

   and the table
   create table employee(
          name varcar(10),
          -- etc
    )

   Using an ORM framework would allow you to map that object with a db
   record automagically and write something like:
   emp = Employee("Ryan")

   orm.save( emp )

   And have the employee inserted into the DB.

   An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) is a piece/layer of software that
   helps map your code Objects to your database.

   Some handle more aspects than others...but the purpose is to take some
   of the weight of the Data Layer off of the developer's shoulders.

   Here's a brief clip from Martin Fowler (Data Mapper):

   Object Model is concerned with the following three concepts Data
   Abstraction Encapsulation Inheritance The relational model used the
   basic concept of a relation or table. Object-relational mapping (OR
   mapping) products integrate object programming language capabilities
   with relational databases.
