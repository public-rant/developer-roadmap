What is Amazon DynamoDB?

   Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides
   fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB
   lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a
   distributed database so that you don't have to worry about hardware
   provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching,
   or cluster scaling. DynamoDB also offers encryption at rest, which
   eliminates the operational burden and complexity involved in protecting
   sensitive data. For more information, see
   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Encry
   ptionAtRest.html]DynamoDB encryption at rest.

   With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and
   retrieve any amount of data and serve any level of request traffic. You
   can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without
   downtime or performance degradation. You can use the AWS Management
   Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics.

   DynamoDB provides on-demand backup capability. It allows you to create
   full backups of your tables for long-term retention and archival for
   regulatory compliance needs. For more information, see
   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Backu
   pRestore.html]Using On-Demand backup and restore for DynamoDB.

   You can create on-demand backups and enable point-in-time recovery for
   your Amazon DynamoDB tables. Point-in-time recovery helps protect your
   tables from accidental write or delete operations. With point-in-time
   recovery, you can restore a table to any point in time during the last
   35 days. For more information, see
   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Point
   InTimeRecovery_Howitworks.html]Point-in-time recovery: How it works.

   DynamoDB allows you to delete expired items from tables automatically
   to help you reduce storage usage and the cost of storing data that is
   no longer relevant. For more information, see
   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/TTL.h
   tml]Expiring items by using DynamoDB Time to Live (TTL).

High availability and durability

   DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables
   over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and
   storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast
   performance. All of your data is stored on solid-state disks (SSDs) and
   is automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an
   AWS Region, providing built-in high availability and data durability.
   You can use global tables to keep DynamoDB tables in sync across AWS
   Regions. For more information, see
   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Globa
   lTables.html]Global tables - multi-Region replication for DynamoDB.

Getting started with DynamoDB

   We recommend that you begin by reading the following sections:

   You can use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate data
   from a relational database or MongoDB to a DynamoDB table. For more
   information, see the
   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/]AWS Database
   Migration Service User Guide.

   To learn how to use MongoDB as a migration source, see

   tml]Using MongoDB as a source for AWS Database Migration Service. To
   learn how to use DynamoDB as a migration target, see
