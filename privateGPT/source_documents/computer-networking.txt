What is computer networking?

   Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can
   exchange data and share resources with each other. These networked
   devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to
   transmit information over physical or wireless technologies.

   Let’s answer some common computer networking FAQs.

How does a computer network work?

   Nodes and links are the basic building blocks in computer networking. A
   network node may be data communication equipment (DCE) such as a modem,
   hub or, switch, or data terminal equipment (DTE) such as two or more
   computers and printers. A link refers to the transmission media
   connecting two nodes. Links may be physical, like cable wires or
   optical fibers, or free space used by wireless networks.
   In a working computer network, nodes follow a set of rules or protocols
   that define how to send and receive electronic data via the links. The
   computer network architecture defines the design of these physical and
   logical components. It provides the specifications for the network’s
   physical components, functional organization, protocols, and
   procedures.

What do computer networks do?

   Computer networks were first created in the late 1950s for use in the
   military and defense. They were initially used to transmit data over
   telephone lines and had limited commercial and scientific applications.
   With the advent of internet technologies, a computer network has become
   indispensable for enterprises.

   Modern-day network solutions deliver more than connectivity. They are
   critical for the digital transformation and success of businesses
   today. Underlying network capabilities have become more programmable,
   automated, and secure.

   Modern computer networks can:

Operate virtually

   The underlying physical network infrastructure can be logically
   partitioned to create multiple "overlay" networks. In an overlay
   computer network, the nodes are virtually linked, and data can be
   transmitted between them through multiple physical paths. For example,
   many enterprise networks are overlaid on the internet.

Integrate on a large scale

   Modern networking services connect physically distributed computer
   networks. These services can optimize network functions through
   automation and monitoring to create one large-scale, high-performance
   network. Network services can be scaled up or down based on demand.

Respond quickly to changing conditions

   Many computer networks are software-defined. Traffic can be routed and
   controlled centrally using a digital interface. These computer networks
   support virtual traffic management.

Provide data security

   All networking solutions come with in-built security features like
   encryption and access control. Third-party solutions like antivirus
   software, firewalls, and antimalware can be integrated to make the
   network more secure.

What are the types of computer network architecture?

   Computer network design falls under two broad categories:

1. Client-server architecture

   In this type of computer network, nodes may be servers or clients.
   Server nodes provide resources like memory, processing power, or data
   to client nodes. Server nodes may also manage client node behavior.
   Clients may communicate with each other, but they do not share
   resources. For example, some computer devices in enterprise networks
   store data and configuration settings. These devices are the servers in
   the network. Clients may access this data by making a request to the
   server machine.

2. Peer-to-peer architecture

   In Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture, connected computers have equal
   powers and privileges. There is no central server for coordination.
   Each device in the computer network can act as either client or server.
   Each peer may share some of its resources, like memory and processing
   power, with the entire computer network. For example, some companies
   use P2P architecture to host memory-consuming applications, such as 3-D
   graphic rendering, across multiple digital devices.

What is network topology?

   The arrangement of nodes and links is called network topology. They can
   be configured in different ways to get different outcomes. Some types
   of network topologies are:

Bus topology

   Each node is linked to one other node only. Data transmission over the
   network connections occurs in one direction.

Ring topology

   Each node is linked to two other nodes, forming a ring. Data can flow
   bi-directionally. However,single node failure can bring down the entire
   network.

Star topology

   A central server node is linked to multiple client network devices.
   This topology performs better as data doesn’t have to go through each
   node. It is also more reliable.

Mesh topology

   Every node is connected to many other nodes. In a full mesh topology,
   every node is connected to every other node in the network.

What are the types of enterprise computer networks?

   Depending on the organization's size and requirements, there are three
   common types of enterprise private networks:

Local area network (LAN)

   A LAN is an interconnected system limited in size and geography. It
   typically connects computers and devices within a single office or
   building. It is used by small companies or as a test network for
   small-scale prototyping.

Wide area networks (WAN)

   An enterprise network spanning buildings, cities, and even countries,
   is called a wide area network (WAN). While local area networks are used
   to transmit data at higher speeds within close proximity, WANs are set
   up for long-distance communication that is secure and dependable.

   SD-WAN or software-defined WAN is virtual WAN architecture controlled
   by software technologies. An SD-WAN offers more flexible and dependable
   connectivity services that can be controlled at the application level
   without sacrificing security and quality of service.

Service provider networks

   Service provider networks allow customers to lease network capacity and
   functionality from the provider. Network service providers may consist
   of telecommunications companies, data carriers, wireless communications
   providers, Internet service providers, and cable television operators
   offering high-speed Internet access.

Cloud networks

   Conceptually, a cloud network can be seen as a WAN with its
   infrastructure delivered by a cloud-based service. Some or all of an
   organization’s network capabilities and resources are hosted in a
   public or private cloud platform and made available on demand. These
   network resources can include virtual routers, firewalls, bandwidth,
   and network management software,with other tools and functions
   available as required.

   Businesses today use cloud networks to accelerate time-to-market,
   increase scale, and manage costs effectively. The cloud network model
   has become the standard approach for building and delivering
   applications for modern enterprises.

What are AWS computer networking services?
