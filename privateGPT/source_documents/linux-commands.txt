   anyway. But in case it doesn’t, this can be a quick command to see the
   directory that you’re in. Another application of this command is when
   creating scripts where this command can allow us to find the directory
   where the script has been saved.

   While working within the terminal, moving around within directories is
   pretty much a necessity. The cd command is one of the important Linux
   commands you must know and it will help you to navigate through
   directories. Just type cd followed by directory as shown below.
root@ubuntu:~# cd <directory path>

   Cd Command Default

   As you can see in the above command, I simply typed cd /etc/ to get
   into the /etc directory. We used the pwd command to print the current
   working directory.

   The cp and mv commands are equivalent to the copy-paste and cut-paste
   in Windows. But since Linux doesn’t really have a command for renaming
   files, we also make use of the mv command to rename files and folders.
root@ubuntu:~# cp <source> <destination>

   Cp Command Default

   In the above command, we created a copy of the file named Sample. Let’s
   see how what happens if we use the mv command in the same manner. For
   this demonstration, I’ll delete the Sample-Copy file.

   When you want to output the contents of a file, or print anything to
   the terminal output, we make use of the cat or echo commands. Let’s see
   their basic usage. I’ve added some text to our New-File that we created
   earlier.
root@ubuntu:~# cat <file name>
root@ubuntu:~# echo <Text to print on terminal>

   Cat And Echo Commands

   As you can see in the above example, the cat command when used on our
   “New-File”, prints the contents of the file. At the same time, when we
   use echo command, it simply prints whatever follows after the command.

   The less command is used when the output printed by any command is
   larger than the screen space and needs scrolling. The less command
   allows use to break down the output and scroll through it with the use
   of the enter or space keys.

   The simple way to do this is with the use of the pipe operator (|).

commands[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/linux-commands#the-
tar-zip-and-unzip-commands]

   The tar command in Linux is used to create and extract archived files
   in Linux. We can extract multiple different archive files using the tar
   command.

   To create an archive, we use the -c parameter and to extract an
   archive, we use the -x parameter. Let’s see it working.
#Compress
root@ubuntu:~# tar -cvf <archive name> <files seperated by space>
#Extract
root@ubuntu:~# tar -xvf <archive name>

   Tar Basic Usage Linux commands you should know

   In the first line, we created an archive named Compress.tar with the
   New-File and New-File-Link. In the next command, we have extracted
   those files from the archive.

   Now coming to the zip and unzip commands. Both these commands are very
   straight forward. You can use them without any parameters and they’ll
   work as intended. Let’s see an example below.
root@ubuntu:~# zip <archive name> <file names separated by space>
root@ubuntu:~# unzip <archive name>

   Zip Unzip Commands

   Since we already have those files in the same directory, the unzip
   command prompts us before overwriting those files.

   When outputting large files, the head and the tail commands come in
   handy. I’ve created a file named “Words” with a lot of words arranged
   alphabetically in it. The head command will output the first 10 lines
   from the file, while the tail command will output the last 10. This
   also includes any blank lines and not just lines with text.

   Linux offers multiple commands to compare files. The diff, comm, and
   cmp commands compare differences and are some of the most useful Linux
   commands you must know. Let’s see the default outputs for all the three
   commands.
root@ubuntu:~# diff <file 1> <file 2>

   Diff Command Linux commands you should know

   As you can see above, I’ve added a small piece of text saying “This
   line is edited” to the New-File-Edited file.
root@ubuntu:~# cmp <file 1> <file 2>

   Cmp Command

   The cmp command only tells use the line number which is different. Not
   the actual text. Let’s see what the comm command does.
root@ubuntu:~# comm <file 1> <file2>

   Comm Command

   The text that’s aligned to the left is the text that’s only present in
   file 1. The center-aligned text is present only in file 2. And the
   right-aligned text is present in both the files.

   By the looks of it, comm command makes the most sense when we’re trying

ount-commands]The df and mount
commands[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/linux-commands#the-
df-and-mount-commands]

   When working with Linux, the df and mount commands are very efficient
   utilities to mount filesystems and get details of the file system.

   When I say mount, it means that we’ll connect the device to a folder so
   we can access the files from our filesystem. The default syntax to
   mount a filesystem is below:
root@ubuntu:~ -->> mount /dev/cdrom /mnt
root@ubuntu:~ -->> df -h

   In the above case, /dev/cdrom is the device that needs to be mounted.
   Usually, a mountable device is found inside the /dev folder. /mnt is
   the destination folder to mount the device to. You can change it to any
   folder you want but I’ve used /mnt as it’s pretty much a system default
   folder for mounting devices.

   To see the mounted devices and get more information about them, we make
   use of the df command. Just typing df will give us the data in bytes
   which is not readable. So we’ll use the -h parameter to make the data
   human-readable.

   The chmod and chown commands give us the functionality to change the
   file permissions and file ownership are the most important Linux
   commands you should know.

   The main difference between the functions of the two commands is that
   the chmod command allows changing file permissions, while chown allows
   us to change the file owners.

   The default syntax for both the commands is chmod <parameter> filename
   and chown [user:group]user:group filename
root@ubuntu:~ -->> chmod +x loop.sh
root@ubuntu:~ -->> chmod root:root loop.sh

   Chmod Command linux commands you should know

   In the above example, we’re adding executable permissions to the

   with the chown command, we’ve made it accessible only by root user and
   users within the root group.

   manage a network.

   The ifconfig command will give you the list of all the network
   interfaces along with the IP addresses, MAC addresses and other
   information about the interface.
root@ubuntu:~ -->> ifconfig

   There are multiple parameters that can be used but we’ll work with the

   When you specify the link for download, it has to directly be a link to
   the file. If the file cannot be accessed by the wget command, it will
   simply download the webpage in HTML format instead of the actual file
   that you wanted.

   Let’s try an example. The basic syntax of the wget command is :
root@ubuntu:~ -->> wget <link to file>
OR
root@ubuntu:~ -->> wget -c <link to file>

   The -c argument allows us to resume an interrupted download.

   UFW and IPTables are firewall interfaces for the Linux Kernel’s
   netfilter firewall. IPTables directly passes firewall rules to
   netfilter while UFW configures the rules in IPTables which then sends
   those rules to netfilter.

   Why do we need UFW when we have IPTables? Because IPTables is pretty
   difficult for a newbie. UFW makes things extremely easy. See the below
   example where we are trying to allow the port 80 for our webserver.
root@ubuntu:~# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
root@ubuntu:~# ufw allow 80

   I’m sure you now know why UFW was created! Look at how easy the syntax
   becomes. Both these firewalls are very comprehensive and can allow you
   to create any kind of configuration required for your network. Learn at

   Do you have some commands that you run very frequently while using the
   terminal? It could be rm -r or ls -l, or it could be something longer
   like tar -xvzf. This is one of the productivity-boosting Linux commands
   you must know.

   If you know a command that you run very often, it’s time to create an
   alias. What’s an alias? In simple terms, it’s another name for a
   command that you’ve defined.
root@ubuntu:~# alias lsl="ls -l"
OR
root@ubuntu:~# alias rmd="rm -r"

   Now every time you enter lsl or rmd in the terminal, you’ll receive the
   output that you’d have received if you had used the full commands.

   The examples here are for really small commands that you can still type
   by hand every time. But in some situations where a command has too many
   arguments that you need to type, it’s best to create a shorthand

Linux[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/linux-commands#the-top
-command-in-linux]

   A few sections earlier, we talked about the ps command. You observed
   that the ps command will output the active processes and end itself.

   The top command is like a CLI version of the task manager in Windows.
   You get a live view of the processes and all the information
   accompanying those processes like memory usage, CPU usage, etc.

   To get the top command, all you need to do is type the word top in your
   terminal.

   Top Command Output Linux commands you shoud know

and-usermod-commands]The useradd and usermod
commands[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/linux-commands#the-
useradd-and-usermod-commands]

   The useradd or adduser commands are the exact same commands where
   adduser is just a symbolic link to the useradd command. This command
   allows us to create a new user in Linux.
root@ubuntu:~# useradd JournalDev -d /home/JD

   The above command will create a new user named JournalDev with the home
   directory as /home/JD.

   The usermod command, on the other hand, is used to modify existing
   users. You can modify any value of the user including the groups, the
   permissions, etc.

   For example, if you want to add more groups to the user, you can type
   in:
root@ubuntu:~# usermod JournalDev -a -G sudo, audio, mysql

ommand-in-linux]The passwd command in
Linux[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/linux-commands#the-pas
swd-command-in-linux]

   Now that you know how to create new users, let’s also set the password
   for them. The passwd command lets you set the password for your own
   account, or if you have the permissions, set the password for other
   accounts.

   The command usage is pretty simple:
root@ubuntu:~# passwd
New password:

   Passwd Command

   If you add the username after passwd, you can set passwords for other
   users. Enter the new password twice and you’re done. That’s it! You
   will have a new password set for the user!
