   I see POSIX mentioned often and everywhere, and I had assumed it to be
   the baseline UNIX standard.. until I noticed the following excerpt on a
   Wikipedia page: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group]The Open
   Group

     The Open Group is most famous as the certifying body for the UNIX
     trademark, and its publication of the Single UNIX Specification
     technical standard, which extends the POSIX standards and is the
     official definition of a UNIX system.

   If the official definition of a UNIX system is an extension of POSIX,
   then what exactly is POSIX? ,,, It surely seems to be a touchstone of
   the UNIX world, but I don't know how it fits into the overall picture.

       SUS is the official definition of UNIX since The Open Group, not
       the IEEE, owns the UNIX trademark. Se my answer below.

   POSIX first was a standard in 1988 long before the Single UNIX
   Specification. It was one of the attempts at unifying all the various
   UNIX forks and UNIX-like systems. POSIX is an IEEE Standard, but as the
   IEEE does not own the UNIX® trademark, the standard is not UNIX® though
   it is based on the existing UNIX API at that time. The first standard
   POSIX.1 is formally known as IEEE std
   1003.1-1988.[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX]1] IEEE charged a
   substantial fee to obtain a copy of the standard.

   The Open Group released the Single UNIX Specification (SUSv2) in 1997
   based on IEEE's work of the POSIX standard. SUSv3 was released in 2001
   from a joint working group between IEEE and The Open Group known as the
   Austin Group. SUSv3 is also known as
   POSIX:2001[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification]2].
   There is now also POSIX:2004 and POSIX:2008 which is the core of SUSv4.
   As for what UNIX® is, UNIX® is whatever the current registered
   trademark holder says it is. Since 1994, that is The Open Group.

   Novell acquired the UNIX® systems business from AT&T/USL which is where
   UNIX® was born. In 1994, they sold the right to the UNIX® trademark to
   X/Open[[http://www.unix.org/what_is_unix.html]3] now know as The Open
   Group. They then sold the UNIX® source code to SCO as
   UNIXWARE®.[[http://www.unix.org/what_is_unix.html]3] UNIX® itself has
   forked many
   times[[http://www.levenez.com/unix/]4][[http://www.bell-labs.com/histor
   y/unix/]5] partly due to AT&T's licensing model. Purchasing UNIX® gave
   you the complete source of the operating system and the full tool-chain
   to build it. Modifications to the source can be distributed and used by
   anyone who owned a license to UNIX® from AT&T. The license fee was in
   the thousands.

   BSD was a project at Berkeley which added a number of enhancements to
   the UNIX® operating system. BSD code was released under a much more
   liberal license than AT&T's source and did not require a license fee or
   even a requirement to be distributed with source, unlike the GPL that
   the GNU Project and Linux use. This has caused a good part of the BSD
   code to be included with various commercial UNIX forks. By around
   4.3BSD, they had nearly replaced any need for the original AT&T UNIX®
   source code. FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD are all forks of 4.3BSD that are a
   complete operating system and have none of the original AT&T source
   code. Nor do they have right to the UNIX® trademark, but much of their
   code is used by commercial UNIX operating systems. The Socket API used
   on UNIX was developed on BSD and the Unix Fast Filesystem code was
   borrowed and used on various UNIX Operating Systems like Solaris with
   their own enhancements.

   Linux was developed in 1991, but was developed from scratch unlike BSD
   and uses the existing GNU Project which is a clean-room implementation
   of much of the UNIX user-space. It implements much of POSIX for
   compatibility and is UNIX-like in design, but it does not have the
   close connection to AT&T or UNIX® that the BSDs have.

       A great answer.. all (3) answers have been good, but this one was
       hugely informative (especially after having been prepped by the
       other 2); just what I needed... and thanks for the comment (below
       the question body) about SUS, I understand it well enough now,
       thanks... (and I didn't notice it was only one paragraph...It was
       too interesting :)

     * Excellent. Thank you. I've been in computing for much of that
       history, but the "gossipy" details of how things happened were not
       something on which I focused. Good to see the trail.

     * @Alex Officially, I think POSIX is not an acronym, but just a name,
       however, it was likely picked from the name "Portable Operating
       System Interface" and given an X at the end to hint at UNIX.
       Neither
       [https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2018edition/]The
       Open Group nor the
       [https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1003.1/7700/]IEEE seem to directly
       explain the choice of name, but both are clear in writing it in all
       uppercase. Lastly, the UNIX programmer's manual, first published in
       1971 writes UNIX in all uppercase like some others sources do as
       well.

       Not mandatory, used by POSIX, but almost nowhere else, notably not
       in GNU. But true, it is too restrictive, e.g. single letter flags
       only (e.g. -a), no double hyphen long versions (e.g. --all).
       A few widely used conventions:
          + - means stdin where a file is expected
          + -- terminates flags, e.g. ls -- -l to list a directory named

   Who conforms to POSIX?

   Many systems follow POSIX closely, but few are actually certified by
   the Open Group which maintains the standard. Notable certified ones
   include:
     * OS X (Apple) X stands for both 10 and UNIX. Was the first Apple
       POSIX system, released circa 2001. See also:

     * AIX (IBM)
     * HP-UX (HP)
     * Solaris (Oracle)

   Most Linux distros are very compliant, but not certified because they
   don't want to pay the compliance check.

   run much, if not all, of POSIX. However, it is focused on developers /
   deployment instead of end users. In particular, there were no plans to
   allow access to the Windows GUI.

   POSIX is the Portable Operating System standard. It describes certain
   utilities, APIs, and services a compliant operating system must provide
   to software (for example sockets, file I/O and threading) along with
   conventions on how these should be called from a program.

   The idea is that a program written for one POSIX-Compliant OS would be
   easier to port to another POSIX-compliant OS than porting between
   non-POSIX-compliant OSes. This is why it is much easier to port an
   application from, say, FreeBSD to Linux than it is to port it from
   FreeBSD to Windows (though Windows ostensibly supports a subset of
   POSIX.)

   POSIX is a subset of UNIX which is intended to cover various Unix-like
   environments for other operating systems; this originally included
   environments such as Eunice for VMS, Windows NT's POSIX personality,
   and Apollo Domain/OS. You can think of it as a standard portability API
   for the subset of operating system services whose behavior is in common
   between Unix and non-Unix. See
   [http://standards.ieee.org/develop/wg/POSIX.html]http://standards.ieee.
   org/develop/wg/POSIX.html for more information.
