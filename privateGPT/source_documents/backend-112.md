Unit testing is where individual 
units
 (modules, functions/methods, routines, etc.) of software are tested to ensure their correctness. This low-level testing ensures smaller components are functionally sound while taking the burden off of higher-level tests. Generally, a developer writes these tests during the development process and they are run as automated tests.

A key to building software that meets requirements without defects is testing. Software testing helps developers know they are building the right software. When tests are run as part of the development process (often with continuous integration tools), they build confidence and prevent regressions in the code.

Functional testing is where software is tested to ensure functional requirements are met. Usually, it is a form of black box testing in which the tester has no understanding of the source code; testing is performed by providing input and comparing expected/actual output. It contrasts with non-functional testing, which includes performance, load, scalability, and penetration testing.

Integration testing is a broad category of tests where multiple software modules are 
integrated
 and tested as a group. It is meant to test the 
interaction
 between multiple services, resources, or modules. For example, an APIâ€™s interaction with a backend service, or a service with a database.
