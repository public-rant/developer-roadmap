hub.io/pcc/source_code]Downloading source code

   The simplest way to get the online resources for the book is to click
   on the [https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc/archive/master.zip]Download
   .zip button at the top of this page, which will download the source
   code files and other resources for the entire book.

[https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/#cheatsheets][https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/c
heatsheets/README.html]Cheat Sheets

   Cheat sheets can be really helpful when you're working on a set of
   programming exercises or a project. This set of
   [https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/cheatsheets/README.html]cheat sheets
   will help remind you of the concepts you're learning, as well as the
   Python syntax for these concepts.

[https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/#updates][https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/updat
es.html]Updates

   Some of the libraries featured in the book have been updated recently,
   which is a good thing - it means you're learning to use Python packages
   that are steadily being improved.

   When packages are updated you have the option of using the version that
   was featured in the book, which lets you run code exactly as it's
   written in the book. You can also choose to install the latest version
   of each package, and modify the code in the book slightly. Each
   approach is outlined clearly in these updates.

   A list of updates is kept
   [https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/updates.html]here.

[https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/#solutions][https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/sol
utions/README.html]Solutions to Exercises

   Solutions are available to selected exercises. Be careful about looking
   at the solutions too quickly; make sure you've given yourself time to
   wrestle with the concepts you just learned before looking at a
   solution. Also, there are several ways to solve most of the exercises,
   and the solutions only show one possible way to complete each exercise.

   You can get to each chapter's solutions from
   [https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/solutions/README.html]here.

[https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/#finding_employment][https://ehmatthes.github.i
o/pcc_2e/finding_employment/]Finding Employment

   People have a wide variety of reasons for learning to code, and finding
   work as a programmer is one of the most common reasons. I posted a
   section called
   [https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/finding_employment/]Finding
   Employment as a (New) Programmer in the resources for the second
   edition of the book. There's nothing specific about the second edition
   in these resources; if you are reading Python Crash Course with the
   goal of finding work as a programmer, you might find this section
   helpful.
