Process Management in OS: PCB in Operating System

   By[https://www.guru99.com/author/lawrence]Lawrence Williams UpdatedJune
   10, 2023

What is a Process?

   Process is the execution of a program that performs the actions
   specified in that program. It can be defined as an execution unit where
   a program runs. The OS helps you to create, schedule, and terminates
   the processes which is used by CPU. A process created by the main
   process is called a child process.

   Process operations can be easily controlled with the help of
   PCB(Process Control Block). You can consider it as the brain of the
   process, which contains all the crucial information related to
   processing like process id, priority, state, CPU registers, etc.

   In this Operating system tutorial, you will learn:

What is Process Management?

   Process management involves various tasks like creation, scheduling,
   termination of processes, and a dead lock. Process is a program that is
   under execution, which is an important part of modern-day operating
   systems. The OS must allocate resources that enable processes to share
   and exchange information. It also protects the resources of each
   process from other methods and allows synchronization among processes.

   It is the job of OS to manage all the running processes of the system.
   It handles operations by performing tasks like process scheduling and
   such as resource allocation.

Process Architecture

   Here, is an Architecture diagram of the Process
     * Stack: The Stack stores temporary data like function parameters,
       returns addresses, and local variables.
     * Heap Allocates memory, which may be processed during its run time.
     * Data: It contains the variable.
     * Text:
       Text Section includes the current activity, which is represented by
       the value of the Program Counter.

Process Control Blocks

   PCB stands for Process Control Block. It is a data structure that is
   maintained by the Operating System for every process. The PCB should be
   identified by an integer Process ID (PID). It helps you to store all
   the information required to keep track of all the running processes.

   It is also accountable for storing the contents of processor registers.
   These are saved when the process moves from the running state and then
   returns back to it. The information is quickly updated in the PCB by
   the OS as soon as the process makes the state transition.

Process States

    Process States Diagram Process States Diagram Process States Diagram

   A process state is a condition of the process at a specific instant of
   time. It also defines the current position of the process.

   There are mainly seven stages of a process which are:
     * New: The new process is created when a specific program calls from
       secondary memory/ hard disk to primary memory/ RAM a
     * Ready: In a ready state, the process should be loaded into the
       primary memory, which is ready for execution.
     * Waiting: The process is waiting for the allocation of CPU time and
       other resources for execution.
     * Executing: The process is an execution state.
     * Blocked: It is a time interval when a process is waiting for an
       event like I/O operations to complete.
     * Suspended: Suspended state defines the time when a process is ready
       for execution but has not been placed in the ready queue by OS.
     * Terminated: Terminated state specifies the time when a process is
       terminated

   After completing every step, all the resources are used by a process,
   and memory becomes free.

Process Control Block (PCB)

   Every process is represented in the operating system by a process
   control block, which is also called a task control block.

   Here, are important components of PCB

   Process Control Block Process Control Block Process Control Block (PCB)

     * Process state: A process can be new, ready, running, waiting, etc.
     * Program counter: The program counter lets you know the address of
       the next instruction, which should be executed for that process.
     * CPU registers: This component includes accumulators, index and
       general-purpose registers, and information of condition code.
     * CPU scheduling information: This component includes a process
       priority, pointers for scheduling queues, and various other
       scheduling parameters.
     * Accounting and business information: It includes the amount of CPU
       and time utilities like real time used, job or process numbers,
       etc.
     * Memory-management information: This information includes the value
       of the base and limit registers, the page, or segment tables. This
       depends on the memory system, which is used by the operating
       system.
     * I/O status information: This block includes a list of open files,
       the list of I/O devices that are allocated to the process, etc.

Summary:

     * A process is defined as the execution of a program that performs
       the actions specified in that program.
     * Process management involves various tasks like creation,
       scheduling, termination of processes, and a dead lock.
     * The important elements of Process architecture are 1)Stack 2) Heap
       3) Data, and 4) Text
     * The PCB is a full form of Process Control Block. It is a data
       structure that is maintained by the Operating System for every
       process
     * A process state is a condition of the process at a specific instant
       of time.
     * Every process is represented in the operating system by a process
       control block, which is also called a task control block.
