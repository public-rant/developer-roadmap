Books related to JavaScript

     * [http://reasonmlhub.com/exploring-reasonml/]Exploring ReasonML and
       functional programming. [https://reasonml.github.io/]ReasonML is
       probably the FP language that is easiest to learn for JavaScript
       programmers (and therefore a good way to get started with FP):
          + It’s a pragmatic language (based on OCaml), with various
            “impure” escape hatches (output, mutable state, etc.).
          + Its syntax is based on JavaScript’s.
          + One of its main goals is good JavaScript interoperability.
