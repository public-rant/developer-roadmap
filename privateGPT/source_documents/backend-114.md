Event sourcing is a design pattern in which the state of a system is represented as a sequence of events that have occurred over time. In an event-sourced system, changes to the state of the system are recorded as events and stored in an event store. The current state of the system is derived by replaying the events from the event store.
One of the main benefits of event sourcing is that it provides a clear and auditable history of all the changes that have occurred in the system. This can be useful for debugging and for tracking the evolution of the system over time.
Event sourcing is often used in conjunction with other patterns, such as Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and domain-driven design, to build scalable and responsive systems with complex business logic. It is also useful for building systems that need to support undo/redo functionality or that need to integrate with external systems.

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They can be broken into three categories:

Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software design approach focusing on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain’s experts.
In terms of object-oriented programming, it means that the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. For example, if a software processes loan applications, it might have classes like LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw.
DDD connects the implementation to an evolving model and it is predicated on the following goals:

In this section, we’ll discuss some essential design and development principles to follow while building the backend of any application. These principles will ensure that the backend is efficient, scalable, and maintainable.
Separation of Concerns is a fundamental principle that states that different functionalities of a system should be as independent as possible. This approach improves maintainability and scalability by allowing developers to work on separate components without affecting each other. Divide your backend into clear modules and layers, such as data storage, business logic, and network communication.
Reusability is the ability to use components, functions, or modules in multiple places without duplicating code. While designing the backend, look for opportunities where you can reuse existing code. Use techniques like creating utility functions, abstract classes, and interfaces to promote reusability and reduce redundancy.
KISS principle states that the simpler the system, the easier it is to understand, maintain, and extend. When designing the backend, try to keep the architecture and code as simple as possible. Use clear naming conventions and modular structures, and avoid over-engineering and unnecessary complexity.
Do not duplicate code or functionality across your backend. Duplication can lead to inconsistency and maintainability issues. Instead, focus on creating reusable components, functions or modules, which can be shared across different parts of the backend.
A scalable system is one that can efficiently handle an increasing number of users, requests, or data. Design the backend with scalability in mind, considering factors such as data storage, caching, load balancing, and horizontal scaling (adding more instances of the backend server).
Security is a major concern when developing any application. Always follow best practices to prevent security flaws, such as protecting sensitive data, using secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS), implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, and sanitizing user inputs.
Testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability and stability of the backend. Implement a comprehensive testing strategy, including unit, integration, and performance tests. Use automated testing tools and set up continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines to streamline the testing and deployment process.
Proper documentation helps developers understand and maintain the backend codebase. Write clear and concise documentation for your code, explaining the purpose, functionality, and how to use it. Additionally, use comments and appropriate naming conventions to make the code itself more readable and self-explanatory.
By following these design and development principles, you’ll be well on your way to creating an efficient, secure, and maintainable backend for your applications.
Test driven development (TDD) is the process of writing tests for software’s requirements which will fail until the software is developed to meet those requirements. Once those tests pass, then the cycle repeats to refactor code or develop another feature/requirement. In theory, this ensures that software is written to meet requirements in the simplest form, and avoids code defects.

CQRS, or command query responsibility segregation, defines an architectural pattern where the main focus is to separate the approach of reading and writing operations for a data store. CQRS can also be used along with Event Sourcing pattern in order to persist application state as an ordered of sequence events, making it possible to restore data to any point in time.
