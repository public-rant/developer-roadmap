   Catherine Paganini
   Catherine Paganini leads Marketing at Kublr. From the strategic to the
   tactical, Catherine helps Kublr evangelize the limitless power of cloud
   native technologies, shape the brand, and keep pace with the growth.
   Before joining the tech startup, Catherine marketed B2B services at
   renowned organizations such as Booz Allen Hamilton and The Washington
   Post. She recently discovered her passion for breaking down complex IT
   concepts so people with no technical background can easily understand
   the current technological revolution brought to us by cloud native tech
   and digital transformation.

   When I set out to run marketing for [http://www.kublr.com/]Kublr, an
   enterprise-grade Kubernetes platform, I needed to wrap my head around
   Kubernetes. I read some articles on the internet, talked to our
   technical team and, at some point, understood the basic concepts.
   However, I didn’t really get the full picture. I realized I needed to
   zoom out, way out. Most articles and technical people start with the
   assumption of context which non-technical people generally don’t have.
   So, I read an Introduction to Computer Science then continued studying
   distributed systems and, oh my god, had I aha-moments!

   Finally understanding the core concepts the new stack is built on was
   so enlightening, I wanted to share my newly found insights with all
   those struggling to understand what this open-source technology is all
   about and why it is so revolutionary.

   Let me start with the basic concept needed to understand where
   Kubernetes came from: the context. For technical folks, this may sound
   very simplistic, and it should. The goal is to offer a simplified
   overview to understand the big picture. I’ll start with a single
   computer, move to virtual machines, and then briefly discuss
   distributed applications. If you’re already familiar with these
   concepts, feel free to jump to what’s new to you.

Bare Metal Machines

   A computer consists of hardware — mainly the central processing unit
   (CPU), memory and storage — which runs different applications or
   programs. The operating system (OS) is a software that sits on top of
   the hardware and manages these resources. Above the OS are the
   applications (e.g. Outlook or the Microsoft stack on your laptop). The
   OS schedules when each app has access to which resource ensuring each
   application has enough to run smoothly (while Outlook and Word may feel
   like they run simultaneously, they don’t. Believe it or not, your
   computer cannot multitask. Programs run one at a time. The intervals
   are so fast, however, that they seem to run simultaneously — that’s OS
   magic!). The applications are oblivious of the hardware, they only
   interact with the OS. This principle is called abstraction: a layer
   that mediates (OS) between two other layers (hardware and apps). Apps
   don’t need to know anything about the hardware because the OS manages
   everything.

   Before virtualization came along there was no way to isolate
   applications on the same machine, or server. When dealing with
   mission-critical applications, companies would typically have one
   application per server to avoid that, if one application crashes, it
   would drag another one down with it. Running one app per machine is
   expensive as each machine has to have the maximum resource capacity the
   app can possibly reach during its peak, even if it only reaches that
   capacity one percent of the time — an inefficient use of compute
   resources. Machines like this (with no virtual machines) are referred
   to as bare metal.

   Co-locating applications optimizes resource utilization. Since it’s
   unlikely that all application will peak at the same time (you only
   co-locate apps that aren’t likely to), applications can share peak-time
   capacity, significantly reducing resource needs. Virtualization enabled
   exactly that by eliminating the risk of one app crashing and affecting
   co-located apps.

Virtual Machines

   A virtual machine (VM) is code that “wraps around” an application,
   pretending to be hardware. The code running inside the VM thinks the VM
   is a separate computer, hence the term “virtual machine.” Just like
   physical machines, VMs require an OS. An OS running inside a VM is
   referred to as guest OS, while the OS on the real machine is referred
   to as host OS.

   Isolated with no risk of affecting co-located applications, multiple
   applications can now run on a single server enabling more efficient
   resource utilization — a true revolution at the time.

   From an application standpoint, there is no difference between running
   on a VM or a real physical machine. From a system administrator’s
   perspective, however, VMs are much more convenient since adding or
   deleting VMs is significantly easier, simplifying day-to-day
   infrastructure management.

Large Enterprise Applications and Distributed Systems

   Enterprise applications can be huge and often require way more compute
   capacity than a single machine can handle. Parallel computing, running
   multiple programs at the same time, may also be required. In order to
   achieve that, multiple machines are connected through a network forming
   a distributed application/system. The two main characteristics of a
   distributed system are (1) a collection of autonomous virtual or
   physical machines (2) that appears as one single coherent system to the
   end-user (which can be a person or an application).

   A group of machines that works together forms a cluster; each machine
   is referred to as a node.   For a cluster to realize a common goal,
   nodes must communicate or “exchange messages.” Over the network, data
   is exchanged, commands given or accepted, status updates provided, etc.

   The key concept here is that a cluster or distributed system becomes
   one big powerful machine even though the nodes may not necessarily be
   located in the same physical location.

   Unless we are dealing with monolithic applications (typically older
   applications that were built as one single entity), these large
   distributed applications are modular and broken down into several
   components that are placed into VMs. This eases updates, fixes, and
   rollouts. It also means that if one component crashes, the entire
   system isn’t necessarily down.

Containers: New Lightweight VMs

   Containers are the next step in the virtualization evolution. Unlike
   VMs which require a guest OS consuming additional resources, containers
   are more lightweight. That means you can deploy a lot more containers
   on a single machine than VMs — again a significant efficiency gain.

   Another great benefit of containers is that they are portable.
   Portability means that they work on and can be moved between any
   environment (e.g. migrate an application from a data center to the
   cloud) without affecting the application. Everything the application
   needs is in the container making it completely environment independent
   — yet another huge development in IT.

   When using VMs, on the other hand, infrastructure dependencies remain.
   Different clouds or data centers have different virtualization tools.
   That means I can’t just take a VM that resides on-premise and move it
   to the Amazon Cloud which uses its own virtualization technology.
   Moving an application requires placing it into a VM for that particular
   environment as well as further configuration and testing. This brings
   additional risk and must be carefully planned and prepared for. All
   this isn’t necessary if you migrate containers, saving companies a lot
   of resources.

Microservices

   Microservices are applications broken down into even smaller
   components. Each microcomponent is called a service — hence
   microservices. More components mean more VMs or containers are needed.
   The fact that containers require a lot less resources made
   microservices feasible for many organizations which is why we are
   hearing so much about them now.

   Placed into a container, each microservice is isolated from one
   another. Why is this beneficial? Well, the smaller an independent
   component, the easier to build, test, deploy, debug, and fix. Clearly,
   it’s much easier to find a bug in a few lines of code than hundreds of
   them. Since they are isolated, it’s also easier to roll back should a
   new feature or update prove problematic. But how micro should a
   microservice be to be considered as such? One way of defining it is
   code that can be built, tested, and deployed within a week.

Container Orchestrators

   If a legacy app with hundreds of VMs migrates to containers, it may now
   be composed of thousands of containers. As you can imagine, managing
   them all manually is just impossible. This is where container
   orchestration tools, like Kubernetes, come in. The orchestrator ensures
   the right number of containers are up and running and, if necessary,
   intervenes to fix it. It automates a lot of otherwise very cumbersome
   manual work which would make it impossible to scale. A container
   orchestrator spans across the entire cluster and abstracts away the
   underlying resources (hardware across the cluster such as CPU, memory,
   and storage).

   While there are a few container orchestrators on the market (Docker
   Swarm is a well-known example), Kubernetes won the container war and in
   2018 all major cloud providers adopted it.

Kubernetes Enters the World Stage

   Originally developed by Google and donated to the open source community
   in 2014, Kubernetes is one of the hottest open source projects right
   now. If you’re reading this you likely know it’s huge, but what exactly
   does it do?

   One way of seeing Kubernetes is as some type of data center or cluster
   OS. As outlined above, a cluster is nothing more than a collection of
   computers running on-premise, in clouds, physical and/or virtual
   machines (yes! You can mix and match) which is connected over a network
   appearing as a single large computer to the user. Cluster resources are
   managed by Kubernetes, just like your OS manages the resources of your
   laptop. Developers don’t have to worry about which CPU or memory their
   apps should use, Kubernetes takes care of that.

Cluster Components

   A cluster is made up of a master node and multiple worker nodes. All
   nodes are Linux hosts (machines running on Linux), although recently
   Kubernetes started supporting Windows nodes as well. The actual
   containerized app is running on the worker nodes. Each container is
   placed in a pod — a sandbox-like environment that doesn’t play a major
   role except for hosting and grouping containers. To scale an app, you
   scale pods with their respective containers, not just containers.

   The master is the brain of the cluster. This is where all control and
   scheduling decisions are made. It ensures the application pods are up
   and running as defined by the declarative state through watch loops
   (more to that below). No applications run on the master except for
   system applications. Its function is purely focused on monitoring and
   managing the cluster.

Kubernetes Benefits

   Kubernetes brings a lot of great capabilities, the most revolutionary
   are:

   Declarative state — at the heart of Kubernetes is the declarative
   model. Developers declare the desired state of their application (e.g.
   how many pod replicas with which configuration, etc. their app needs)
   and Kubernetes implements watch loops to ensure the cluster doesn’t
   deviate from the desired state. This is a very powerful capability and
   enables self-healing and scaling.

   Self-healing — enabled by the declarative model, Kubernetes ensures the
   cluster always matches the declarative state. Meaning it heals itself
   when there is a discrepancy. If Kubernetes detects a deviation,
   Kubernetes kicks in and fixes it (e.g. if a pod goes down, a new one
   will be deployed to match the desired state).

   Auto-scaling — Kubernetes has the capacity to automatically scale up
   (spin up more nodes and/or pods) when capacity peaks (e.g. more people
   watching Netflix on a Friday evening requires a lot more compute
   resources from Netflix’ servers) and down again after a peak. This is a
   tremendous asset, especially in the modern cloud, where costs are based
   on the resources consumed.

Kubernetes Is Great, But…

   Kubernetes is really hard. Expertise is hard to find and it’s not a
   full-fledged, ready-to-use solution. Kubernetes and containers are only
   one part of the puzzle. To run applications on Kubernetes in
   production, enterprises need an entire technology stack. You’ll need
   something for logging and monitoring (gather and analyze application
   metrics to know if all is going well), role-based access control,
   commonly abbreviated as RBAC, (to ensure only those who should get
   access to a cluster do), disaster recovery, and much more. Configuring
   and fine-tuning these different technologies so they work well with
   Kubernetes is no easy task and requires significant resources—time,
   money, and highly specialized skills. Additionally, Kubernetes’
   quarterly release schedule means, companies have to keep up with
   regular updates. Most organizations have neither the resources nor the
   in-house expertise to deploy pure open-source Kubernetes.

   The complexity of Kubernetes gave birth to numerous Kubernetes
   solutions. Just visit
   [https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north
   -america-2019/]KubeCon, the official Kubernetes conference, and you’ll
   see an entire show floor full of Kubernetes solutions — all trying to
   ease Kubernetes adoption. While some address one particular area (e.g.
   Portworx, Linkered), others focus on a broader area such as security,
   compliance, and operations (e.g. Kublr). It can be pretty confusing
   navigating the space as, at first sight, they are all Kubernetes
   solutions. However, while the space seems crowded it really isn’t, at
   least not as much as it may seem.

The Business Impact

   Breaking applications down into microservices has allowed today’s big
   cloud-born enterprises (e.g. Amazon, Google, Uber) to rapidly push out
   new features and updates or roll them back should they not work as
   planned. This provides them with the agility to adapt quickly,
   outpacing more traditional competitors. This trend has put enormous
   pressure on more traditional organizations as their pace of change is
   significantly slower. The current trend towards digital transformation
   is driven by the competitive advantage these technologies are providing
   their adopters. As more companies adopt these technologies,
   organizations are forced to adopt them too or risk becoming obsolete.

   Containers and Kubernetes have revolutionized how companies do business
   today. Software is playing an ever-increasing role for business success
   and these technologies are enabling the software to improve and adapt
   to market demands at an ever-increasing pace. Today, IT is no longer a
   vertically aligned department; it runs horizontally across the entire
   organization. Every department is enabled by software, be it a new data
   analytics tool providing valuable insights about market trends or an AI
   platform that customizes content to customer needs, increasing
   retention. Whoever adapts and evolves faster, has a competitive edge.

   Since we are at it, let’s put three more related buzzwords into
   context: cloud native, DevOps, and digital transformation — all part of
   this trend. The cloud native stack, also referred to as the new stack,
   is used to build cloud native applications. Cloud native applications
   are defined as containerized, dynamically orchestrated (a.k.a.
   Kubernetes), and microservices-oriented. While developed for the cloud,
   the cloud native stack is not cloud-bound. Today, a lot of enterprises
   deploy containers and Kubernetes on-premises, sometimes even in
   air-gapped environments (environments completely isolated from the
   outside world with no connectivity). In fact, many of Kublr’s users
   come to us for that particular use case.

   DevOps, a methodology enabled by cloud native technologies, integrates
   development, IT operations, quality assurance, and IT security. Well
   implemented, it translates into better code, reduced cost as well as a
   more motivated team. Getting there, however, requires a huge cultural
   shift within the organization. In fact, experience has shown that it’s
   easier to adopt the new stack (and that’s quite challenging already!)
   than changing the corporate culture to embrace this radically different
   way of doing things.

   Digital transformation is the broader term that characterizes this
   entire trend. It refers to the process of moving an organization to an
   agile software-first approach to cope with the rapidly changing
   technology developments — imperative to stay competitive today. Digital
   transformation is enabled and made more efficient and agile by the new
   stack and a DevOps approach.

   I hope this provided you with the necessary context to read on and
   learn more about this exciting space. We are currently witnessing a
   true IT revolution and understanding what’s going on is pretty
   exciting! If this article was helpful or if you have any comments,
