Operating System - I/O Hardware
     __________________________________________________________________

   One of the important jobs of an Operating System is to manage various
   I/O devices including mouse, keyboards, touch pad, disk drives, display
   adapters, USB devices, Bit-mapped screen, LED, Analog-to-digital
   converter, On/off switch, network connections, audio I/O, printers etc.

   An I/O system is required to take an application I/O request and send
   it to the physical device, then take whatever response comes back from
   the device and send it to the application. I/O devices can be divided
   into two categories −
     * Block devices − A block device is one with which the driver
       communicates by sending entire blocks of data. For example, Hard
       disks, USB cameras, Disk-On-Key etc.
     * Character devices − A character device is one with which the driver
       communicates by sending and receiving single characters (bytes,
       octets). For example, serial ports, parallel ports, sounds cards
       etc

Device Controllers

   Device drivers are software modules that can be plugged into an OS to
   handle a particular device. Operating System takes help from device
   drivers to handle all I/O devices.

   The Device Controller works like an interface between a device and a
   device driver. I/O units (Keyboard, mouse, printer, etc.) typically
   consist of a mechanical component and an electronic component where
   electronic component is called the device controller.

   There is always a device controller and a device driver for each device
   to communicate with the Operating Systems. A device controller may be
   able to handle multiple devices. As an interface its main task is to
   convert serial bit stream to block of bytes, perform error correction
   as necessary.

   Any device connected to the computer is connected by a plug and socket,
   and the socket is connected to a device controller. Following is a
   model for connecting the CPU, memory, controllers, and I/O devices
   where CPU and device controllers all use a common bus for
   communication.
   Device Controllers

Synchronous vs asynchronous I/O

     * Synchronous I/O − In this scheme CPU execution waits while I/O
       proceeds
     * Asynchronous I/O − I/O proceeds concurrently with CPU execution

Communication to I/O Devices

   The CPU must have a way to pass information to and from an I/O device.
   There are three approaches available to communicate with the CPU and
   Device.
     * Special Instruction I/O
     * Memory-mapped I/O
     * Direct memory access (DMA)

Special Instruction I/O

   This uses CPU instructions that are specifically made for controlling
   I/O devices. These instructions typically allow data to be sent to an
   I/O device or read from an I/O device.

Memory-mapped I/O

   When using memory-mapped I/O, the same address space is shared by
   memory and I/O devices. The device is connected directly to certain
   main memory locations so that I/O device can transfer block of data
   to/from memory without going through CPU.
   Memory-mapped I/O

   While using memory mapped IO, OS allocates buffer in memory and informs
   I/O device to use that buffer to send data to the CPU. I/O device
   operates asynchronously with CPU, interrupts CPU when finished.

   The advantage to this method is that every instruction which can access
   memory can be used to manipulate an I/O device. Memory mapped IO is
   used for most high-speed I/O devices like disks, communication
   interfaces.

Direct Memory Access (DMA)

   Slow devices like keyboards will generate an interrupt to the main CPU
   after each byte is transferred. If a fast device such as a disk
   generated an interrupt for each byte, the operating system would spend
   most of its time handling these interrupts. So a typical computer uses
   direct memory access (DMA) hardware to reduce this overhead.

   Direct Memory Access (DMA) means CPU grants I/O module authority to
   read from or write to memory without involvement. DMA module itself
   controls exchange of data between main memory and the I/O device. CPU
   is only involved at the beginning and end of the transfer and
   interrupted only after entire block has been transferred.

   Direct Memory Access needs a special hardware called DMA controller
   (DMAC) that manages the data transfers and arbitrates access to the
   system bus. The controllers are programmed with source and destination
   pointers (where to read/write the data), counters to track the number
   of transferred bytes, and settings, which includes I/O and memory
   types, interrupts and states for the CPU cycles.
   DMA

   The operating system uses the DMA hardware as follows −
   Step Description
   1 Device driver is instructed to transfer disk data to a buffer address
   X.
   2 Device driver then instruct disk controller to transfer data to
   buffer.
   3 Disk controller starts DMA transfer.
   4 Disk controller sends each byte to DMA controller.
   5 DMA controller transfers bytes to buffer, increases the memory
   address, decreases the counter C until C becomes zero.
   6 When C becomes zero, DMA interrupts CPU to signal transfer
   completion.

Polling vs Interrupts I/O

   A computer must have a way of detecting the arrival of any type of
   input. There are two ways that this can happen, known as polling and
   interrupts. Both of these techniques allow the processor to deal with
   events that can happen at any time and that are not related to the
   process it is currently running.

Polling I/O

   Polling is the simplest way for an I/O device to communicate with the
   processor. The process of periodically checking status of the device to
   see if it is time for the next I/O operation, is called polling. The
   I/O device simply puts the information in a Status register, and the
   processor must come and get the information.

   Most of the time, devices will not require attention and when one does
   it will have to wait until it is next interrogated by the polling
   program. This is an inefficient method and much of the processors time
   is wasted on unnecessary polls.

   Compare this method to a teacher continually asking every student in a
   class, one after another, if they need help. Obviously the more
   efficient method would be for a student to inform the teacher whenever
   they require assistance.

Interrupts I/O

   An alternative scheme for dealing with I/O is the interrupt-driven
   method. An interrupt is a signal to the microprocessor from a device
   that requires attention.

   A device controller puts an interrupt signal on the bus when it needs
   CPU’s attention when CPU receives an interrupt, It saves its current
   state and invokes the appropriate interrupt handler using the interrupt
   vector (addresses of OS routines to handle various events). When the
   interrupting device has been dealt with, the CPU continues with its
   original task as if it had never been interrupted.
