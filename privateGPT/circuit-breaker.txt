circuit-breaker

> Answer (took 323.67 s.):
 In cloud computing environments, backpressure refers to an application or system releasing resources that can be used by other processes when they become overwhelmed. The process involves managing resource usage in real time so as not to overload the available capacity and prevent cascading failures across a distributed network of systems such as servers running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing platform, which provides automatic scaling for its services based on demand.
Backpressure helps ensure that resources are allocated appropriately by preventing excessive load from consuming too many system resources at once or overloading the capacity to process requests in real time while ensuring data is processed efficiently and effectively without causing significant latency issues across various instances of a cloud service such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) web server.
In summary, backpressure involves using algorithms that manage resource allocation by releasing them when they are not being used or consumed at an efficient rate to prevent cascading failures in the system with multiple services running simultaneously and maintaining data integrity within applications on AWS computing platform without causing significant latency issues while processing requests effectively through use of load balancers.

i m going to just try letting some
requests through maybe one maybe a few
and if that request succeeds probably
the service is healthy again
and then i ll i ll eventually let
everything through but if that request
fails then i ll just say okay i m giving
up again
i m going to going to waste some time so
from the
from the point of view of of the the
client the circuit breaker becomes
essentially
almost like a proxy for the service and
what it s really doing is adding a whole
lot of intelligence
